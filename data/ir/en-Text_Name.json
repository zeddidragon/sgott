    "text": "A one-off Tree Frog model that D.R.O.S. Arms manufactured specifically for the Blast team.\n\nThis launcher is capable of releasing two types of incendiary grenades. Based on how long the \ntrigger is held for, the user can select between standard grenades, which have a huge blast range \nand deal ample damage, and adhesive grenades, which stick where they land and inflame their \ntarget for a certain duration. While the adhesive grenades deal no direct damage, their flames are \nstrong enough to push Aggressors back, drastically slowing enemy advancement.\n\nAs always, D.R.O.S. has tuned the weapon to favor attack power over reload time, but even taking \nthis into account, this is an excellent weapon that EDF Command is considering for mass production."

Its 1st level charge releases the rotational \nslash, and its 2nd level charge releases the wide slash.\n\nOn top of having a large ammo capacity, it also has Recharge ability; however, its Energy Core is \nsmall, so it takes 4 seconds to recharge a single swipe. It can easily overheat if you perform many \nstandard slashes in succession."

    "text": "A one-off Silverback model that Khan-Wang manufactured specifically for the Blast team.\n\nThis masterwork shooter attains firepower comparable to the power-focused Arabesque series, \nwhile retaining the acclaimed usability of the Sonic Pile series. To achieve this, the weapon borrows \nenergy from the PA-Gear when fired. Models from the rival Arabesque series also use PA-Gear \nenergy, but do so by borrowing energy from the gear's actuators, which prevents movement while \nshooting. In contrast, this model borrows from the energy condenser, allowing you to move even \nwhen shooting.\n\nOf course, no advantage comes without a drawback. Because it drains PA-Gear energy each time it \nis fired, care must be taken to not overheat."

However, its stun duration is \nextremely short, so enemies will revert to their normal state soon after this weapon stops them in \ntheir tracks.

Ironically, the key to unlocking their weakness was found in the giant \ncreatures the Aggressors themselves released.
