Basically a mobile fortress developed for land combat. Equipped with a main battleship-class cannon and two rotating turrets, as well as thick armor. The trade-off, however, is that all of these features add to its weight, making it a bit sluggish.\n\nIts main cannon is the EDF's state-of-the-art Requiem Cannon, originally developed as a naval gun but then equipped on tanks after reducing the size of its barrel. This has resulted in a further reduction to its initial velocity, so some skill is necessary to hit the desired target.\n\nThere are two sub-cannons located on the top of the main cannon. It can fire armor-piercing ammunition and one shot can hit many enemies. The main cannon and sub-cannons all rotate. The sub-cannons are located on the top of the main cannon so when the main cannon rotates, the direction of the sub-cannons will also change. It is equipped with a missile launcher on the left and right to prevent enemies from approaching.\n\nIn order to re-request this, you need to achieve a certain number of credits during the mission by defeating enemies.

It launches enormous laser-guided missiles. \nBecause a laser guide is necessary for targeting, this weapon cannot be used alone: it must be paired with an Air Raider's Laser Guide Kit (or a guide beacon) to establish a viable target lock. Through the Laser Guide Kit, the lock-on location is confirmed. When the laser guide location (or a guide beacon) is within the sight (red square), pressing the attack button will lock-on. Then, when the attack button is released, the missile will launch directly toward the targeted location. On impact, it will explode spectacularly, inflicting damage across the entire area.\nThe lock-on process requires not only the support of an Air Raider, but also a considerable amount of time. When used effectively, however, it can be a formidable weapon, wiping out the enemy in the entire area.",

    "High-Speed Laser Guide Kit",
    "An improved Laser Guide Kit model that improves lock-on speed at the cost of a shorter range. However, lock-on speed is dramatically improved. \n\nDevice that sends the lock-on information to your allies' homing weapons (missiles, etc.) The device has no ability to attack by itself. \n\nBy projecting a laser to a spot, it 'paints' the target, confirming the location for an allied lock-on target weapon. The lock-on time for your allies' homing weapons is greatly reduced. Also, the range is extended up to 5 times their own range. (For example, if the Fencer has a weapon with a lock-on speed of 5 seconds and a lock-on distance of 100m, he can lock on the target that is up to 500 meters away 1 sec later when the Air Raider uses this weapon.)\n\nThe homing weapon locks on to the point indicated by this weapon, not the enemy itself. When your allies launch the homing missile, it will head in the direction indicated by the laser. Therefore, if the laser is moved after launch, the missile will move accordingly. For that reason, the laser needs to be maintained until the target is hit.\n \nUsually only one missile can be launched per lock-on, but it is possible to have multiple lock-ons for the laser point. It is therefore possible to launch multiple missiles at one target.  \n \nThe majority of Fencer missiles rely on the support of this device. When Fencers are equipping missiles, you should equip this device as well.",

When the attack button is released, homing missiles are fired at the locked-on target(s) and explode upon impact.\n\nTo use this weapon effectively, the back of your powered exoskeleton must be equipped with a Side Thruster.

    "A perfected Ion Mirror Shield model equipped with a new type of deflector. The effective range has been expanded horizontally and the load on the shield when the deflector is activated has also been reduced.\n\nHolding the attack button will keep raising the shield and reduce Damage coming from the front. (The defense angle differs based on shields. Please refer to %dq%Defense Angle.%dq%)\nSome weapons allow you to attack with the shield raised. While it is not possible to pair the shield with a hammer or blade that requires full body usage, it is possible to attack with the Blasthole Spear and other weapons that can be fired with one hand when the shield is raised. \nThe heat will increase as it continues to absorb attacks. When it reaches the limit, it won't be usable again until it has cooled down. \n\nThere is a device called Deflector installed inside the shield.  It forms a magnetic field which reverses physical motion by 180 degrees. The Deflector is activated with the use button. It can repel any attack with the right timing.",

    "A Beacon Discharger.\nUse this beacon to signal a Rocket Cannon attack from the gunship that is circling the skies, and it will launch an attack where the beacon hits.\n\nAn improved version of the T2 Rocket Cannon. Its destructive power is the same, but the rockets will now strike the target even more swiftly than before.\n\nPress the attack button to discharge a beacon which will start guiding only when hitting an object, so it could be useless if you target at somewhere with no objects. Also, a beacon out of range will activate its safety device and disable it. In short, the beacon must hit an object in range. There is a laser device equipped on the Beacon Discharger to determine the range. Once you confirm the laser light has hit the object in range, you can discharge the beacon with certainty that the beacon can be activated properly.\n\nThe loading work for the coming fire is conducted in a gunship, so the weapon can still be reloaded even if the Air Raiders are not carrying it.",
