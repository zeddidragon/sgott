    "Think about what happens if we let the aliens claim our cities! We have show them this planet is ours.",

    "The Primers went back where they came from. We won. The future is bright...I hope.",

    "Fill 'em with bullets!",
    "This is bad. There's too many of them!",

They attacked underground bunkers I didn't even know existed... There's only one explanation. Their first attack led to nuclear war. So they adapted. They sent the missile locations to the past so they could destroy them at the outset of the war.",

    "兵士23-3",
    "They're covered in armor! Where do we even aim?!",
    "These enemies have new gear. This is going to be tough.",

    "I'm going to die!! Uahhh!!!",
    "Withdraw to Team B's position.",
    "隊長23-1",
    "Aim for their heads! That should take them out!",
    "Enemy landing ships incoming!",
    "Expect landing ships. Exterminate every alien they drop.",

    "This is an Aerial mobility model. Aerial mobility type Android confirmed.",
    "The alien elites have dropped!",
    "Those are their elites!",
    "Mission complete. Let's get these soldiers medals.",
    "Enemy airships identified at your location.",
    "There's no need to attack the enemy's new ship. Let it pass through.",

    "兵士24-5",
    "兵士24-6",
    "If that thing is indeed a Teleportation Anchor, the usual methods should take it out.",
    "We may assume the tip is the teleporter. Attack the glowing mechanism.",
    "兵士374",
    "The upper tip is its weak spot. Attack the part that's lit up.",
    "There's more than one Big Anchor!",
    "Dammit! It must be to protect its weak spot.",
    "Took down an enemy new-type ship.",
    "The light screen appears to have a dome shape, like an upturned glass. You may be able to attack it from right below it.",
    "Plant yourself right below that thing and shoot from under the light screen.",
    "The lower part should have no shield so it can let down what it teleports. It's risky but we need you to attack it from below.",

    "兵士24-9",
    "兵士２６",
    "Wanna bet whether we run outta food first or the bots get to us first?",
    "A shield that covers its weak spot. Weapons to ward off approaching infantry.",
    "Impossible. How could they do it in this short a time?",
    "It can't be a coincidence. They underestimated us at first. But they're improving now that they've been counterattacked. They're devising new pesticides.",

    "They're literally coming out of nowhere!",
    "Heavy tanks have arrived.",
    "We need data. Engage them.",

    "兵士87-17",
    "Until now, we thought there needed to be a teleporter on the receiving side but...this situation just threw that out the window.",
    "All of the teleporters we've identified so far were receivers. Exits, to put it another way. You'd go in through an entrance somewhere to emerge at a receiving teleporter. However, the enemy may have means of teleportation without receivers.",
    "More aliens!",
    "Grim Reaper, enemy confirmed.",
    "And again. What is going on?",
    "I knew it. This isn't normal.",
    "Their equipment is damaged?",
    "They are all wounded, but we've tried our best to gather everyone who can still fight.",
    "They've always had brand new gear up until now. But these aliens' weapons...",
    "Maybe the Primers are running out of soldiers. Could be.",
    "But they're still our enemies. We're in no position to feel sorry for them. Wipe them out.",
    "The aliens that appeared in the vicinity have begun to make a run for it.",
    "Careful. Flying types are approaching.",
    "戦車兵63-4",
    "It's no small number.",
    "There's a Mother!",
    "The aliens have occupied this town. We're taking it back.",
    "If we let it escape now, we won't get another chance. We have to destroy it right now.",
    "They haven't noticed our approach. Infiltrate the town and deal with them one by one.",
    "What do you think is here?",
    "Annihilate these Alien guerillas.",
    "Shoot down all Teleportation Ships. Make them regret holding back against us.",
    "This town is home to healing hot springs. Who knew even aliens would visit them?",
    "This is my hometown. Help me get it back from these invaders.",
    "It's an egg! It's huge!",
    "Do you mean to say they're deserters?",
    "More aliens defeated!",
    "Be thankful that it's not crashing onto your head!",
    "It seems all of the aliens that were teleported had gathered here.",
    "If you're not here to sightsee, then get the hell out.",
    "So they're not robots!",
    "What a disorderly bunch. Maybe they just gathered here to try and survive.",
    "They're dropping aliens.",
    "Given time, they would've scrounged up a leader and become a fearsome army. We were able to nip that in the bud.",
    "I almost feel sorry for them. They couldn't call this town home either.",
    "兵士26-1",
    "Join my squad. I need soldiers like you.",
    "兵士26-2",
    "隊長26-1",
    "There are red ones mixed in among the swarm. Stay focused.",

    "隊長26-2",
    "Sorry we're late. Let's team up.",
    "兵士26-9",
    "Who the heck is that?! They're some sort of drone destroyer!",
    "兵士26-10",
    "Yeah, taking all our kills.",
    "兵士26-11",
    "That's fine.",
    "Who cares as long as we win? Follow their lead!",
    "Cougar 3, smooth sailing.",
    "We owe you, kid. You're pretty darn good.",
    "Team 1, move across the mountain ahead and approach their nest.",
    "兵士107-6",
    "We're following the tanks!",
    "What exactly do they want?",
    "兵士27-1",
    "I see monsters.",
    "Crush 'em.",
    "What you do need to avoid is the purple mist. They can also secrete poison, so don't get caught in it or you'll get hurt.",
    "We have Giant Androids, confirmed. Watch yourselves.",
    "Demolish those Giant Androids!",
    "These tanks should withstand Giant Android attacks, though not for too long.",
    "Don't retreat; meet up with the sergeant instead.",
    "A flat-bodied robot, huh?",
    "It looks like a new fleet is moving to your vicinity. There's a chance enemy ships will appear in your area.",
    "Seems those ships really can teleport.",
    "In which case they can send reinforcements as needed. This is going to prove a grueling battle.",
    "First phase complete. Top floor under control. We'll be going to the center floor after taking a break.",
    "兵士27-4",
    "Pulling back.",
    "Team B is to the left. Link up with them.",
    "It's like they're appearing out of thin air!",

    "No. Only god possess of such power. And that thing isn't god. It's an evil invader.",
    "Small nest destroyed.",
    "Those are grenadiers. Watch out for their grenades.",
    "斥候27-4",
    "Confirming these Androids are carrying grenades.",
    "Destroyed!",
    "We're dealing with grenadiers now?!",
    "This is Storm 2. Heading out to rescue Storm 4.",
    "兵士27-5",
    "I guess every species has gathered here!",
    "Heads up! Something's dropping in!",
    "This is bad. Those things are on another level.",
    "兵士27-6",
    "兵士27-7",
    "They're coming right for us with those bombs! Run away!",
    "No! You stay the heck away!",

    "兵士27-11",
    "兵士27-12",
    "兵士27-13",
    "The grenadiers are essentially bombs with mobility. An assault by a sizeable group would make any location a challenge to defend.",
    "These enemies themselves are bombs--lifeless mechanical bombs wandering the city. What a terrible sight.",
    "斥候27-6",
    "Enemy ship.",
    "They're still coming?!",
    "There's a large number of grenadiers coming. There are so many of them. Too many...",
    "They're starting to walk!",
    "Bチーム隊長",
    "Don't drag your feet, Team A. It's not much better over here.",
    "Then Team A's safe.",
    "But no matter who's here, at this rate, we're all goners!",
    "グリムリーパー兵士27-1",
    "You're going home alive. You're welcome.",
    "A high mobility type! That does not sound good!",
    "They're flying! Flying all over the place!",
    "More like swinging around! I can see a cable or something!",
    "They're wires! That's what they're using to get around!",
    "It's a decoy!",
    "It's a damn circus out here! They've sent out acrobatic Androids now!",
    "Barga 3 charging forward! AHHH!",
    "Machine acrobats?! I can't get a good shot. They're too fast!",
    "You take any and every risk when you don't fear death. These are stunts no living creature can truly emulate.",
    "They're fast! They don't usually move that fast!",
    "It makes them look like they're flying! There's no aiming at that!",
    "Just spray and pray! You'll hit them eventually!",
    "Just look at these! They're not like any of the ones so far!",
    "They're heavily armored! Oh, no!",
    "They won't go down easy! Shoot them until there's nothing left to shoot!",
    "They adapted to the situation too quickly. Had they planned everything out already? Or are they simply able to produce new weapons at a rate we can only imagine?",
    "Successfully eliminated the King.",
    "A heavily armored variant! And they're no joke!",
    "We can't shoot them dead! What's going on?",
    "Their shells are incredible! Our bullets are just bouncing off!",
    "隊長27-6",
    "Destruction is spreading throughout the world. Enemy ships of a new kind keep dropping Androids in numbers that exceed even the monsters.",
    "The enemy's new ship models are continuing to rain down Androids. Their numbers are dramatically exceeding our projections.",
    "Looks like we're in agreement. We need our heavy tanks in the battles to come. We can't afford to lose them.",
    "So, this is happening across the globe. At this rate, the Earth is going to become a world of Androids.",
    "戦車兵63-5",
    "That's a huge fleet.",
    "隊長27-7",
    "Time to do some extermination!",
    "Closing in on the enemy ships!",
    "Hostiles are raining down. Proceed with caution. Foot soldiers, don't stray too far from the tanks.",
    "But there is still hope. Forces in North America are still trying to take down Mothership 3.",
    "隊長27-8",
    "Fine, then. I'm in.",
    "Is this the 2nd troop of the Earth invasion forces?",

    "Chop-chop. Group up with Delta.",
    "They're fast!",
    "Those Androids are high mobility models!",
    "What in the world are those?!",
    "Those are flying organisms known as Haze!",
    "There's another egg over there!",
    "We're counting on you.",
    "We're dealing with airborne Haze!",
    "戦車兵27-2",
    "Forget the tanks. Go!",
    "Enemy ship in the skies.",
    "They're tailing us!",
    "They're at our heels, just like that!",
    "We can't shake them!",
    "Don't stop to try and fight them properly. It's too risky! Delta's right there!",
    "斥候146-28",
    "We don't have the numbers for this! Keep them at bay but stay on the move!",
    "Dammit! Those bastards are using the buildings!",
    "That damages the architecture! Cut it out!",
    "Green monsters are approaching!",
    "They're zipping around with wires! Not even death frightens those things!",
    "兵士800",
    "It's a circus of death out here!",
    "Not to mention, they get mad!",

    "Grouping up with Charlie!",
    "Dead ahead! Let's go!",
    "Divided you're gonna get picked off one by one. Group up, then fend them off together with Charlie.",

    "兵士８５",
    "They're moving by way of those wires.",

    "We make our defenses impenetrable and we make it out alive. Are we clear?",
    "Don't expect reinforcements!",
    "We're going home alive.",
    "This one's a Nix Powered Exoskeleton. I can vouch for its performance.",
    "It's a Gravis Powered Exoskeleton. The armor's tougher than a Nix.",
    "We found the aliens' weak points after examining their bodies.",
    "It's the BMX10 Proteus. Humanity's trump card.",
    "The unit's almost there. I'm counting on you.",
    "This here's the BMX10F Proteus Sigma. Our latest prototype.",
    "兵士27-33",

    "Fire! Don't let those mobile types get close!",

    "Those bastards at headquarters betrayed us!",
    "兵士28-2",
    "Are we meant to be the suicide squad?",
    "I'll take care of any that get close.",
    "Those yellow orbs are grenades! Be sure to hit them!",

    "Clear those explosives!",
    "You wanted to blow things up? We'll blow you up!",
    "Almost there.",

    "Ignore the ship. Take care of the Grenadiers.",
    "Their new ships can travel more than ten kilometers in an instant. They must have predetermined waypoints to keep their fleet intact.",
    "So they've got rendezvous points set up? I imagine speed becoming a problem.",
    "New enemy ship in the air!",
    "Incoming Androids! Wait, what are those?!",
    "Are you absolutely sure?!",
    "This is an Erginus-class enemy. Don't underestimate it.",
    "Giant Grenadiers carry giant grenades. Do not get close. Attack them from afar.",

    "We're gathering all teams who can still fight.",

    "Seems everyone is done for.",
    "The Storm Team is being attacked. We have to do something!",

    "Our home is now a monster's nest.",
    "兵士500",
    "Do you know why Mother Monsters built their nest here? They need a sturdy area for their powerful offspring.",
    "They're red monster eggs. Destroy them!",
    "Our reinforcements won't make it. Destroy the Anchors with current forces.",
    "Are these eggs glowing?!",
    "This is NOT looking good!",
    "We will let the whole world know about this victory. Today, we sunk the enemy command ship.",
    "So this is what those Mother Monsters are after.",
    "Eliminate them before they get any bigger.",
    "A gold monster! No one's ever survived one. We have to take it down now!",
    "Their strength when fully grown is unfathomable. We should eliminate it now, while we can.",
    "兵士268",
    "We can decrease the number of monsters if we defeat this thing!",
    "Eliminate the Mother Monster.",
    "斥候38-1",
    "Engage!",
    "Trespassing and squatting. What a world we live in.",
    "We didn't know that there were others who broke through the enemy lines.",
    "伍長",
    "Anyway through the northern corridor? There should be an untouched supply room there.",
    "Negative. It's completely collapsed. There's no way through there.",
    "We'll go from the surface. The supply room is only 500 meters below.",
    "This is the demolition team. Please take down the teleportation ships quickly.",
    "We'll go from the surface. If we approach from the coastline, it'll be only 300 meters.",
    "That sounds like a terrible plan. We'll all die if we head up to the surface.",
    "We found a certain bacteria on a Kruul's body. It's the same one as found on Martian rocks.",
    "And what of it?",
    "I heard all of humanity's knowledge and resources have been put into those things. Even genetic records and plant seeds. A literal Noah's Ark.",
    "Well, it indicates a certain fact. That the Primer civilization comes from Mars.",
    "Seems like the aliens in the area are transporting Araneas. If they start to multiply, all hell will break loose. We have to exterminate them now.",
    "兵士41-1",
    "How could this be...how?!!",
    "There they are!",
    "Ready arms.",
    "Do not forget how many lives are in our hands. There are 500 civilians down below. We can't fail!",
    "Were all those monsters born inside the cave?",
    "Do not forget how many lives are in our hands. There are 300 civilians down below. We can't fail!",
    "Dammit! They're here!",
    "YES! This is wonderful news! This is the first time we've damaged a mothership!",
    "They can't enter underground. Most likely monsters.",
    "They can't enter underground. Most likely other beings.",
    "Another one's in!",
    "基地の指揮官",
    "I've fought about a dozen of these things, but they are creepier underground.",
    "Onward, Storm 1.",
    "It's better than facing the alternative. Make quick work of it!",
    "What the hell is it doing here?!",
    "Aim at the enemy. Then pull the trigger. Easy, huh?",
    "All units stand your ground. Don't give them an inch.",
    "So they've found their way underground.",
    "Look at this hole. The underground city is not safe anymore.",
    "Did they dig this hole?",
    "I can't believe they've reached us all the way here.",
    "Sheesh! They really are formidable.",
    "Head to Point B.",
    "Do as we do! Exterminate them asap!",
    "These creatures are natural enemies of Wing Divers!",
    "It's like an Alien...",
    "Unit 3, major damage. I'm out.",
    "A natural enemy because we live underground!",
    "So they've finally discovered us here.",
    "Deployment completed.",
    "An Excavator's outer shell deflects bullets! Don't just shoot them all willy-nilly!",
    "Huge bastard!",
    "They open their shell when attacking. That's when they are most vulnerable!",
    "Wait til their outer shell opens!",
    "I can't hit them!",
    "Their bodies are flat!",
    "They're thin as ice! Aim carefully!",
    "They're designed to move between surfaces, whether it's bedrock or rubble. How troublesome.",
    "兵士841",
    "A single one of them means casualties. Find them and destroy them.",
    "It's aliens in spacesuits! We got our work cut out for us.",
    "兵士41-2",
    "兵士41-3",
    "Dammit! There's still some left!",
    "The enemy ship's weakness is the Teleportation Device at its tip.",
    "Sometimes I can't tell which is worse, the surface or the underground.",
    "This is Panther 4. We've arrived on the scene.",
    "Did they eat all the residents?",
    "Yeah, I know.",
    "Which is better, the underground or the sea?",
    "I hate the surface. I don't even wanna look at the sky.",
    "There are 300 civilians. We must stop the enemy.",
    "There are 100 civilians. We must stop the enemy.",
    "What a sandstorm. The electronic equipment is malfunctioning.",
    "Powered Exoskeletons are arriving momentarily. Leave the flying-types and the species γ to Powered Exoskeletons.",
    "兵士679",
    "兵士19",
    "Time to rock.",
    "Have you seen anything like them before?",
    "Yeah, but just the thought sends shivers down my spine. I will never go to the surface.",
    "I suppose they are now the overlords of Earth.",
    "I would have never believed that demons would rule over the surface 3 years ago.",
    "I would have never believed that the sea would be ruled by demons 3 years ago.",
    "I would have never believed that the sky would be ruled by demons 3 years ago.",
    "The monsters are building nests underground. There's one already made nearby.",
    "Robots that move under the surface? I guess we really have nowhere to hide.",
    "If an underground bot finds us, that's it. Residential quarters will disappear. Even this place...",
    "I'm afraid...it wants to kill whoever destroyed the command ship.",
    "I can't believe they're coming after us underground...",
    "Let's start with the aliens.",
    "Excavator sighted!",
    "We're happy in our underground settlement. You can't have it!",
    "Damn robot! You won't get away with this!",
    "What in the world! These wafers move like rats!",
    "It's species β! They are spitting threads!",
    "兵士411",
    "Enemies are coming outta this hole!",
    "Nice!",
    "No, not yet!",
    "Spotted large Winged Alien army.",
    "This way!",
    "You mean there's more?",
    "I suspect so. Find all of them and exterminate 'em.",
    "Crap! I don't know who they are, but are they really going to start a war?",
    "They move between tight spaces. There isn't anywhere they can't reach.",
    "So they were made to eliminate humans who went underground?",
    "A bona fide killing machine. They'll destroy us all.",
    "If they get to the settlement it's all over! Stop those things!",
    "Their numbers are appalling. Must be a nest nearby.",
    "So they've found their way underground. Truly merciless...",
    "Find any remnant enemies.",
    "Did that monster escape from a zoo or something?",
    "A bot has discovered this place. They'll be sending their big guns here.",
    "You take the lead. You've got the most experience.",
    "Take the lead. You're more experienced than us.",
    "Time's running out. We have to go to the surface and search for the Ring.",
    "Going to the surface means sure death if they find us. What shall we do...",
    "Timing is everything. One mistake and we're done for. Ngh, there goes my ulcer again.",
    "兵士1178",
    "That's a wrap. We can finally take a breather.",
    "But where are these enemies coming from anyway?",
    "There's nothing here. Maybe it's over there?",
    "Look over there! They're coming in!",
    "There's no end of them!",
    "There seems to be other monsters! Let's go!",
    "This place is done for!",
    "We can't let them get past us. Shoot!",
    "Stop them! There are 300 civilians behind us!",
    "The robots are using water pipes like a subway!",
    "That isn't good. There are water pipes scattered all over the city.",
    "They can go wherever they want!",
    "兵士１３",
    "This is a manmade facility. Be sure to pay your dues!",
    "Bring them down by any means necessary. We cannot have them altering history.",
    "A monster found us. The underground city is no longer safe.",
    "Today's victory is ours!",
    "Oh no! They are so many of them!",
    "Look! Monsters are coming down hard!",
    "It's no time to sing hallelujah, it's raining monsters!",
    "It's because they found us! They must know more people are in the area!",
    "The robots are here. We're not even safe underground anymore.",
    "Fire!!",
    "It's an underground facility that was in construction. It's now become a breeding ground for monsters.",
    "They've got free access through here. That can't be good.",
    "兵士1259",
    "Why would they do something like this?",
    "Engage the enemy. Blast them away with your shotguns.",
    "Don't tell me...those monsters are originally from Earth?",
    "I'll return safely, I promise.",
    "兵士448",
    "The surface belongs to the demons. There's no hope in returning alive.",
    "Crap! Who the hell is behind all this?",
    "Can you see the size difference? The big ones are Krakens. The small ones are Dark Monsters.",
    "The surface belongs to the Kraken. You'd be dead on sight.",
    "Do not flinch if you see them. Fear will lead to death.",
    "The Earth is controlled by demons. We are only alive because they allow us to be.",
    "If we don't attack the pylons, this won't be an end to it!",
    "Calm down! Don't panic!",
    "I still can't see the Ring's weak point. I'm going below it.",
    "The Earth is controlled by the Kraken. We are only alive because it allows us to be.",
    "How are the other areas looking?",
    "Battle drone approaching!",
    "We fight. No matter how scary they are, they can't be invincible to our firepower.",
    "I heard one look makes you go crazy. Just a rumor.",
    "We're far from the sea. I'll manage.",
    "The Mermen of the deep. Pray I don't see one.",
    "The Fishmen of the deep. Pray I don't see one.",
    "They are amphibious. Don't let your guard down.",
    "The Kruul...!",
    "A merman...",
    "This ain't no fairy tale, that's a fishman!",
    "The Primer must not expect us to be going back in time. There's no way for them to know about this place, either. In fact, the accident hasn't even happened yet because we've gone back. Not even the Primer will be able to know about an accident that hasn't taken place. We're the only ones aware of the fact that the time machine will be destroyed today.",
    "The Kraken...",
    "Alien snipers confirmed. Requesting gunship strike.",
    "The monster in the sky gives me the creeps.",
    "Look!",
    "Help!",
    "All units, battle stations. The aliens are coming.",
    "So those are the demons!",
    "We stop them here!",
    "Do not cower! Shoot, shoot, shoot!",
    "Kruuls can die from bullet wounds. Keep shooting them!",
    "I can't land a single shot!",
    "They are stopping our bullets!",
    "They are blocking with their arms!",
    "What on earth are those?",
    "Attack the shield until it turns black, then aim at the Kruul's body.",
    "What are they doing all the way here?",
    "兵士299",
    "They're about to attack!",
    "A little one! It's fast! Look out!",
    "They plan to crush us!",
    "AFVs, charge in!",
    "We've confirmed Big Anchors. Please be extra careful.",
    "You have a license for that thing?",
    "Above us! Dark monsters!",
    "It's got monsters with it! An unfathomable amount!",
    "I see big ones and small ones!",
    "So that's the Kraken. What a sight.",
    "So they can live on land and in water? That's horrifying.",
    "They're moving too fast. I can't even aim!",
    "Another egg!",
    "I'm being engulfed in darkness!",
    "To all units in combat. The enemy main force has left this area. Now continue to attack and recover the city.",
    "KG6 Kepler, sending a Naegling Self-Propelled Rocket onto the battlefield.",
    "Get away from the darkness. You'll lose all sight!",
    "This is Sky Bat. Commence attack.",
    "Visuals are getting worse. Watch out for friendly fire!",
    "Teleportation Anchors incoming!",
    "A smokescreen! Don't be misled!",
    "They disappeared into the darkness! Stay on your toes!",
    "Incoming mermen!",
    "Incoming Kraken!",
    "The Kraken is here!",
    "The monsters are here!",
    "There's the Kraken!",
    "They're coming down!",
    "High Mobility Android detected!",
    "That would lead them straight to us! If they find the underground city, it's game over!",
    "I shouldn't have come to the surface! I'm going back underground!",
    "They won't even let you run. It's do or die, team!",
    "If you want to go home, defeat the Mermen!",
    "If you want to go home, defeat the Kraken!",
    "You survived. Lady Luck must be on your side.",
    "This is grand. Now we can look for the Ring on the surface. I have an idea where it may be. Give me a minute.",
    "That is to say, time to do what we always do.",
    "Ranger unit is going to back you up. Hold your ground!",
    "We always resurface to look for the Ring. After accessing the operating sensor, we can determine its location.",
    "These robots practically skim the ground when they fly!",
    "It was a bigger miscalculation than I thought. It'll take some time to detect it. We've just got to survive up here until then.",
    "兵士960",
    "通信兵42-1",
    "Teleportation Anchor cannons are powerful. Use buildings and other places of cover to approach them.",
    "Lieutenant! We've got a problem... We're surrounded by demons!",

    "They're here to kill us!",
    "兵士963",
    "通信兵42-2",
    "兵士962",
    "通信兵42-3",
    "Excuse me?!",
    "There are too many enemies. Evacuate the civilians!",
    "A King's been detected!",
    "Watch out! Fishmen!",
    "Got a visual on the Fishmen!",
    "This isn't good! They've trapped us like rats!",

    "There's so many of them!",
    "斥候X15-3",
    "We are being completely surrounded!",
    "There's a hole up there!",
    "That skyview will be the death of us!",
    "An army of Dark Monsters. It's the end of the world as we know it.",
    "兵士54-1",
    "They've got two shields. Just breaking one won't be enough!",
    "兵士307",
    "Hit the shields then aim for the body!",
    "This is impossible...",
    "We have defeated them before. There's a way to fight them.",
    "Listen. They may have multiple weapons, and their shields do deflect our bullets. But even they have limits.",
    "Don't shoot in the same spot. If you hit a shield, change your target. If you keep shooting different spots, you'll eventually hit them where it hurts.",
    "Arms 1, initiate combat.",
    "If you kill a Dark Monster, their darkness spreads. The black fog doesn't cause damage, but will blind you. The fog spreads and dissipates in time, so you have to stay collected. Leave the darkness and regain your sight. Or wait it out.",
    "The exit is not far. We'll be fine once we get back to the surface.",
    "斥候146-25",
    "Sounds like a solid plan.",
    "Alien incoming.",
    "No! We're going to be wiped out at this rate!",
    "Time to do this and go home. We leave no one behind.",
    "They're tightening up defenses. This is getting worse by the minute. It's never been this bad before...",
    "This isn't good. The Kruuls are guarding the Ring.",
    "This isn't good. The Fishmen are guarding the Ring.",
    "This isn't good. The Krakens are guarding the Ring.",
    "Hey! Anyone here?!",
    "I'm so done for. Anyone out there!",
    "隊長85",
    "Engage the enemies right here. Get ready.",
    "Hey! This way!",
    "I don't wanna spend another minute on the surface.",
    "We did it! We beat them!",
    "This means we can go home!",
    "Let's not waste any time getting back to the underground.",
    "It's time. We'll use Tunnel 1 to get right under the Ring and attack.",
    "兵士63-11",
    "It's time. We'll use Tunnel 2 to get right under the Ring and attack.",
    "Glowing domes! There are Shield Bearers!",
    "It's time. We'll use Tunnel 3 to get right under the Ring and attack.",
    "They're all gone.",
    "Listen up. Their shields are not invincible.",
    "兵士X16-11",
    "重戦車兵142-1",
    "I saw an elite Kruul. They've got two shields.",
    "兵士712",
    "All units, get in position!",
    "Stay alert! They've got two shields!",
    "There's no way for us to know how the Primer have changed history, but we can hypothesize. They must have intervened somewhere in the past few days.",
    "Kruul elites, huh?",
    "兵士730",
    "Of course, your name and deeds will be included in the records. As the hero you are.",
    "My armor?!",
    "They must possess a weakness.",
    "They may hold two shields, but that does not make them all powerful. Two shields must mean they have limits.",
    "I see it now. The shields are protecting the left and right sides respectively. Focus attacking the left or right.",
    "I see it now. The shields are protecting the top and bottom sides respectively. Focus attacking the top or bottom.",
    "Their shields get smaller with every hit and will eventually be depleted. A depleted shield turns black and can't be moved. It does reboot so attack before it does.",
    "Species γ incoming.",
    "Attack the shield until it turns black, then aim at the Kraken's body.",
    "We'll part ways here. Don't worry. If you go with the corporal, you'll be fine.",
    "Don't relax even if you dodge! They can change targets midair!",
    "No such luck. There are a few here, too.",
    "Red Drones!",
    "We'll have to force our way through.",
    "This kind of drone possesses overwhelming fighting ability. The entire infantry unit was almost eliminated by just a few of them…",
    "It's an army of mermen!",
    "Turning back is certain death. Keep moving forward!",
    "隊長X16-2",
    "Look at all this mist...",
    "This mist is a sign that those things are around.",
    "Use the mist to your advantage. Use it as cover for our escape.",
    "The Teleportation Anchors are activated!",
    "What you do need to avoid is any colored mist. They can also secrete poison, so don't get caught in it or you'll get hurt.",
    "Don't shoot if you don't have to. Just pass through without getting noticed.",
    "Come back. It's this way.",
    "Infantry, stay close to the AFVs. The cover fire will help us to move up.",
    "Get back here. It's dangerous to go alone.",
    "Come back here.",
    "Where'd you go? Fall in now!",
    "隊長93-3",
    "Eggs. There must be monsters around.",
    "The monsters have completely polluted the area since we abandoned the surface.",
    "The surface is done for.",
    "Enemy ships are landing!",
    "We're not here to eliminate monsters. Our goal is only to survive.",
    "How do you know that?",
    "兵士182",
    "There are too many eggs. This path is too dangerous.",
    "Hooligan cannon, now firing.",
    "Then we'll go around.",
    "One Six here. We've just arrived. What's the situation?",
    "That is a Deroy B. Its legs are equipped with missiles. The missiles are low-speed, but they can lock on to targets and change trajectory. Shoot them down before they land.",
    "It's too early to relax. The gunshots will surely attract more to this location.",
    "According to past data, it appears that soldiers in the past trained their mental fortitude through marches in the snow. Such a march can be experienced in this level, aside from the cold. Please proceed in the snow alongside your allies.",
    "There's no guarantee we'll lose them. Let's stand our ground.",
    "Fight to clear a path!",
    "Hurry to the base. It's right over there.",
    "There are more of them!",
    "Over there! Shoot 'em!",
    "Come on, let's go. We'll be dead meat if we stay here.",
    "All I see are eggs.",
    "There are monsters here. But compared to the others...",
    "You might even call these ones cute.",
    "Humanity lost a decisive battle to the Mermen. That's when everything changed.",
    "Anyway, it isn't safe here. Let's go.",
    "We fought the Fishmen for years and lost, so we had to give up. They could have the sea, and we would have to live underground.",
    "Those damn mermen stole the seas from us.",
    "We've located the Ring. Mission accomplished. Now we just have to get back in one piece.",
    "Look! It's a Glaukos!",
    "Don't agitate it. We're dead if it attacks.",
    "Snipers are the most fearsome enemies on the battlefield. Get it?",
    "Is the enemy is swarming because of the Glaukos?",
    "The Fishmen tend to gather where Glaukos do. This may very well be the most dangerous place on the surface of the planet.",
    "I wonder what happened to the vanguard.",
    "A monster that coexists with the Fishmen is...just terrifying. If only we could have prevented this from happening...",
    "Three have been killed! That acid is dangerous!",
    "They're gathering around it.",
    "What's that!",
    "Haze approaching.",
    "Hide. Now.",
    "Let's hide and wait it out.",
    "The mist is clearing up. Now's our chance.",
    "The mist is rolling in.",
    "Come this way!",
    "What do you think you're doing? You have a death wish?!",
    "You going on a rampage here of all places? Give me a break!",
    "I know. But we can't continue the mission anymore.",
    "Dammit! Exterminate them before returning to base!",
    "Go after you take a break. You'll have backup.",
    "Such a small strike team... should be a surprise to the aliens.",
    "We don't have much time. Use Tunnel 2 to get right under the Ring and attack.",
    "Just in case you didn't know, they're coming from above.",
    "But anyone who gets near the Ring dies. Isn't there some other way?",
    "Fine. But we can't follow you up to the surface.",
    "That's fine. I know you'll back us up.",
    "兵士８０",
    "That's fine. I know you much better than you think.",
    "This way won't be easy. Looks like there's a monster nest at the end of the tunnel.",
    "Let's destroy the nearby flying-type and secure this area.",
    "If even the underground's this bad, there's no way we can surface!",
    "There is also the short-legged type!",
    "Yeah, I think so.",
    "Attacking the Ring sounds crazy. The minute you step outside you'll be swarmed.",
    "Should we prioritize saving civilians?",
    "All we need to do is get close to it. I'll do the rest.",
    "It's your life on the line.",
    "We shouldn't stop. Let's move.",
    "It came in through the hole.",
    "To think I'd see monsters here...",
    "Another one!",
    "We'll move toward the target while exterminating the hostiles.",
    "Alright, let's move it on up.",
    "This hole. Is this it?",
    "Androids are coming down!",
    "It's not one of our tunnels.",
    "I've looked into it before. Two troops died on that mission.",
    "That monster is huge!",
    "兵士501",
    "Monsters will use caves and tunnels to build nests. This one is still in the making. They need an outlet to the surface to dump soil and rocks.",
    "A King is approaching!",
    "The monsters dug a hole that leads to a tunnel. If the robots found this, they'd surely swarm inside.",
    "I've looked into it before. Three troops died on that mission.",
    "The robots dug this hole that connects to the tunnel. It leads up to the surface.",
    "The monsters are coming from several dens. Don't let your guard down.",
    "Right. You heard him, stay alert.",
    "What's with this place?",
    "Did those monsters make this cave?",
    "Intercept the aliens! Incoming!",
    "It's another cave.",
    "There was a huge space.",
    "Look for an exit.",
    "How do we get out?",
    "There's the way out!",
    "The exit! It's over here!",
    "Watch out! Above us!",
    "They're coming through a hole up above!",
    "They're above us!",
    "They're behind us!",
    "Enemies from the hole behind us!",
    "Watch your six! Behind you!",
    "兵士761",
    "It's the robots! They're here!",
    "I didn't expect to see robots here!",
    "The tanks are destroyed!",

    "Robots?! That's rather odd.",

    "They aren't above, they're this way!",
    "Impossible... This isn't how I remember it.",
    "History is being altered bit by bit.",
    "Even the flap of a butterfly's wings can cause a storm. The smallest miscalculation may change the course of history.",
    "Dammit! Destroy them!",
    "You really know how to fight. That's what I call a veteran and a hero.",
    "They've even sent these things down for us!",
    "Why would they chase us underground?! Damn stalkers!",
    "Destroy them if you want to live!",
    "Grenadiers! There are grenadiers here!",
    "Shoot them before they close the distance!",
    "They hunt us relentlessly. What on Earth is driving them to kill humans like this?",
    "Why are they out to kill us? What have we ever done to them? Just leave us alone already!",
    "We somehow managed to survive.",
    "We shouldn't stay for too long. Let's move.",
    "And you have access to military radio systems too. Somebody must be putting a lot of trust in you.",
    "High-speed Androids? I've heard the rumors.",
    "Armored Androids? I've heard the rumors.",
    "隊長6",
    "I repeat. Those who can fight, please join our operation.",
    "I thought we were the only survivors in the area.",
    "Attacking the Ring? That's nuts.",
    "Today is the day. I'm sure of it.",
    "We must get to the Ring.",
    "The lot of you are too impulsive. Does your life mean nothing to you?",
    "Adequate pressure is not being provided on player. Now investigating countermeasures.",
    "It has to be done.",
    "Right here! This is our target!",
    "Shoot the monsters dead even if you get bitten!",
    "We can resurface from here.",
    "Large Androids!",
    "Something big's there!",
    "Thread shooting monsters are here!",
    "We've been devastated. If this keeps up...",
    "Enemy attack! From above!",
    "Those brutes got to the underground through here!",
    "This is Titan. We are in position.",
    "Look! Digging bots!",
    "They're coming out of the holes on that cliff!",
    "Stay alert! Digging bots inbound!",
    "The Spriggan unit? They aren't cute and cuddly, they are witches!",
    "Trying to turn the tables on us, huh? Not today!",
    "Open fire! We have the tactical advantage from here!",
    "Seems we clean up pretty well.",
    "This is my hometown! Get the hell out!",
    "隊長X12-25",
    "Sure you won't reconsider this plan?",
    "There is no time to waste now. Sergeant, support the Dolphin team and the Rabbit team right away.",
    "That's right. Don't shoot at the huge nest in the center. We'll start by destroying the smaller nests in the periphery.",
    "I'll be back. Thank you, Lieutenant.",
    "I'll be back. Thank you so much, Lieutenant. For everything.",
    "隊長49-1",
    "I was moved the first time I heard it, but it just gets embarrassing after this many times.",

    "If we destroy the nets, we can save those who were captured.",
    "If you are caught by threads, defeating the Aranea sets you free.",
    "You can still attack even if you are caught in its net. Keep firing and don't give up.",
    "The Aranea spin nets to capture their prey. They're only active in tight spaces and relatively don't cause much damage. However, their threads are stronger than the Beta subspecies. Countless soldiers have lost their lives fighting these damn things.",

    "So this net belongs to that ugly thing? Exterminate it!",
    "There are eight members from the missing team. Find them.",

    "兵士49-11",
    "Judging by their numbers, it's not a big nest. Let's destroy it.",
    "Yeah. When can I wake up from this nightmare? I will wake up in my bed, right?",
    "兵士49-12",
    "A flyer's nest is too dangerous to keep around. Take it out.",

    "斥候49-1",
    "This is Scout. The Mother Ship has activated its cannons.",

    "Purge every last one of them!",
    "So that's Storm 1.",
    "Do you feel that rumbling? Something's in the ground.",

    "An unknown species, huh?",
    "スカウト146-1",
    "I feel tremors. There are monsters down there.",

    "That mountain over there?",
    "We've got a friendly at the top. Commence rescue!",
    "Stay out of the way, Spriggans!",
    "Please! I've got a fiancée back home! I can't die here and leave her all alone!",
    "兵士720",
    "I can't thank you enough. You're definitely invited to the wedding.",
    "There should still be monsters lurking. Stay on guard.",
    "Aaahhh!",
    "Gammas! Those things are trouble!",
    "Gammas incoming! Eliminate them!",
    "They won't be easy to handle. Fencers, move out!",
    "This place has promise. If we keep up our efforts, perhaps one day...",
    "Fighters incoming. They will blow the enemy to pieces.",
    "So they have their own language, just like us...",
    "A large fleet of Primers has appeared in the vicinity. So many, so suddenly... We may finally have them by the tail.",
    "斥候146-1",
    "Then we'll send your pets to hell!",

    "They are showing up here as well. All units, watch your airspace.",

    "斥候146-6",
    "Engage.",
    "Jackpot. They chose this hour and this area for their time warp.",
    "It no mere coincidence that you are here. After fighting countless battles all over the world, we have reached this inevitability.",
    "兵士405",
    "Those are Timeships. They warp through both space and time changing history. We have to shoot them down before the fleet disperses.",
    "If we take them down, we limit how much they can change the course of history. The survival of the human race is on the line here. We're counting on you.",
    "See the glowing part at the front? That's the ship's weakness.",
    "The enemy ship is shielded with armored plates. But the teleportation device is unguarded. Aim for that glowing part in the front.",
    "We can't destroy those drones' armors with our weapons. Let's use the railgun instead.",

    "Aliens will drop from landers.",
    "Ahhhh!",

    "斥候146-27",
    "It's an army of giant monsters!",
    "This feels wrong. I don't want to fight them.",
    "We've done it. We may have only sunk a few of their history-altering ships, but I've no doubt that we ruined their plans.",
    "Is the EDF just a bunch of cowards? Hell no! We don't get eaten! We do the eating!",
    "And now they disperse. Off to change history.",
    "I'll have our air forces follow them. If there is any truth to our intel, they would be humanity's biggest targets.",

    "Show them the true power of the Blue Jackets!",
    "The enemy keeps rushing in! Blow them all away!",
    "Grim Reaper has been sent to the combat area. Should arrive momentarily.",
    "You grubby grenadiers! I'll show you how powerless you are against a sniper!",
    "We've got Keplers! Take care of them before they get too close!",
    "I feel like the hero of some zombie movie.",
    "They're charging in blindly! One after the other!",
    "Aim for their grenades! Blow them to smithereens!",
    "Enemy approaching from the side!",
    "On our left and right! A pincer attack!",
    "The Powered Exoskeleton was crushed like a bug!",
    "兵士50-10",
    "They're attacking all at once!",

    "They look...gross.",
    "兵士48-3",

    "They've gotta be cursed!",
    "隊長48-2",

    "True monsters. In every sense of the word.",

    "These guys won't go down with just infantry. We'll provide artillery support.",
    "Infantry! Use the tanks as cover and attack.",

    "隊長15-1",
    "There's too many. We can't do it alone!",
    "That can't be! How does the enemy know about the underground facility?",
    "Only those with A-Class clearance knew about Base 6. It even has a cloaking function.",
    "Monsters incoming. Seems like a subspecies of Aggressive Alien Species γ.",
    "This base was only known to a select few, and it is impossible to spot from above. There's no way they would target it...unless they knew.",
    "That is one hell of a weapon!",

    "We have no other choice. Let's go.",
    "Aliens with heavy arms. They must be guards for their artillery.",
    "So they predicted we would attack their artillery.",
    "We need to collect more data. To get a grasp for their weapons' capabilities, draw out the battle for as long as you can.",
    "The enemy's weapon is powerful. Keep your distance.",
    "We did it. The Ring's done for.",
    "Actually, you'd be better off in close combat. Their weapon has range and power, but takes time between each shot to reload. Get close enough to take advantage of that reload window.",
    "Okay. So that weapon isn't all-powerful. Timing is key.",

    "It's starting to move!",
    "Take down that drone!",
    "That's an enhanced Type 3, a high-grade version. It's got a high-power laser and reinforced armor. Infantry may have trouble taking it down.",
    "The civilians are now in combat with the enemy.",
    "So what do we do?",
    "Does that mean, the difference between us and the Primers, lies not only in terms of technology?",
    "Aim for the orb in the center. It barely has any shielding. That should shut it down.",
    "The aliens are protecting those monsters.",
    "We're hitting it, but nothing's happening. It's got thick plating!",
    "The center! Aim for the orb in the center!",
    "Hng! It took out my armor in an instant!",
    "It can pierce our armor with a single attack?",
    "兵士982",
    "Though few in number, there are high-grade drones being made.",
    "Similar to the red-colored drones based on the Type 1.",
    "But high performance means production and operational costs are also high. I suspect the High-Grade Type 3 requires time to charge before using any advanced functions.",
    "Let's cut out the color coding and just call them High-Grade Types 1, 2, and 3 from now on.",

    "Storm 1, board the Barga.",
    "The enemy is in disarray!",
    "These shields are more than just tools! They're imbued with the spirit of humanity's technology!",
    "There's no way we'll just run away. We need to find what caused this.",
    "Take them down before they melt our shields!",
    "We can't penetrate them with bullets!",
    "Drone destroyed.",

    "Is it really gonna work out that well?",
    "We have to do this now. We're retaking the town.",
    "Aim for its cannon. According to our information, that's its weakness.",

    "Androids even bigger than Large Androids. Infantry weapons can barely scratch their thick armor.",

    "That eye-like part is its weakness. Aim for its eye.",
    "There's a ridiculously huge one over here!",
    "Giant Android successfully destroyed.",

    "Hey there, Chief. Looks like they're giving the both of us one awful job after the next.",
    "That just shows how much they trust us.",
    "I could have nine lives and it still wouldn't be enough.",
    "第二チーム隊長",
    "We have our guns. It's easy to fight in a long, thin path if anything.",
    "They're coming from the sides!",
    "第二チーム兵士１",
    "You will finish the job, while we act as bait.",
    "Gamma Invaders! Take 'em out!",
    "It's too dangerous to go deeper with Gammas still around. Eliminate all monsters in the area.",
    "隊長14",
    "Confirming request.",
    "The water! There's something in the water!",
    "Gammas! Stay alert!",
    "兵士X7-1",
    "There are more than I thought in here. This cave's dangerous.",
    "The monsters are getting closer.",
    "Tremors detected. It's likely a pack of Gammas.",
    "Gammas coming. Get ready.",
    "ここも怪物に汚染されてる。",
    "They're here! Fire!",
    "Monster extermination complete.",
    "This is just a monster nest. So far, at least.",
    "I've got a bad feeling about this.",
    "They're coming from this way too!",
    "第二チーム兵士３",
    "Enemies signs ahead!",
    "And from over there!",
    "This is bad, we've been trapped!",
    "We won't be able to push through! They'll wipe us out!",
    "An ambush, huh? They want to pull us into their nest and wipe us all out.",
    "Dammit! Reinforcements won't make it in time. You'll have to keep yourselves safe.",
    "Androids! Androids are coming!",
    "They're attacking us at the worst possible time!",
    "I knew it. Androids. So they were here on the center floor.",
    "A secret Primer plan, huh?",
    "Hey! What are those?",
    "If that's the case, we got lucky finding this place.",
    "Maybe, but they're ready for us. We're in their stronghold. They're gonna put up a tough fight.",
    "The captain's spotted an Android unit. The center floor is their base of operations. Be careful.",
    "斥候165-3",
    "We're getting close. I think we're gonna run right into each other. We'll ambush them and take them out.",
    "Something's heading this way again!",
    "Get ready for combat. We'll ambush them and take them out.",
    "Androids! A huge unit of them!",
    "兵士428",
    "Are you kidding me?! I'm not taking another step further!",
    "Androids! They're back!",
    "They've got grenades equipped. Destroy the yellow orbs before they get close.",
    "Second phase complete. We're passing through the center floor and infiltrating the bottom.",
    "Rifle team, engage.",
    "Dammit! Does he think he can beat us there?!",
    "Robots this far underground?!",
    "Subterranean robots known as Excavators. They're believed to be weapons used to attack underground facilities and shelters.",
    "We were too late. There's no city left to save...",
    "Damned Primers. They're that well prepared?",
    "Anchor battery has activated!",
    "The bottom floor doesn't look to be a monster nest. No telling what's down here.",
    "Hurry up! We're getting there first!",
    "There's too many of them! Retreat! Retreat!",
    "Don't let the captain beat us there!",
    "Looks like you're safe and sound. C'mon, the route's this way.",
    "I'm so glad you're okay.",
    "It's because Chief's with us.",
    "I don't sense any enemies.",
    "Just us?",
    "We destroyed them all in the middle floor. It's got to be an empty husk down here.",
    "Huh, so I guess they were camped out on the middle floor.",
    "Keep it together and remember your training no matter what!",
    "It's too quiet. Be on the lookout for traps.",
    "We need to be careful for traps at times like this.",
    "I can't believe the fight is still going on.",
    "What's with this cave?",
    "Something's different about the air in here. Guess the bottom floor isn't a monster nest.",
    "Never thought I'd see this underground.",
    "It's a trap!",
    "There's no end to these monsters so long as there's a teleporter here!",
    "That was a close one.",
    "Dammit! What a cowardly move.",
    "I imagine there are traps ahead too. Let's advance with caution.",
    "Again! Another trap's been activated!",
    "There's a trap!",
    "A trap using a Teleportation Device, huh? They're starting to fight in more cunning ways.",
    "Just gonna be monsters.",
    "Maybe some mole-beast.",
    "A giant mole, huh? I bet it'd be pretty cute.",
    "I think we're near the deepest area. Don't let your guard down.",
    "Enemies are coming out from the base!",
    "I'm telling you, it's gotta be treasure. That's why they're hiding it. But it's gonna be all mine.",
    "A underground lake.",
    "There's something in the darkness! And it's big!",
    "We need better footage. Please get closer.",
    "Deploying a backup team.",
    "This is bad! It's about to fly!",
    "Unidentified lifeform is ascending.",
    "Exterminators, engage. Infantry, provide support for Proteus.",
    "Is it trying to get to the surface?!",
    "We can't, the enemies are right in front of us.",
    "It's about to fly off.",
    "兵士806",
    "This is bad. Who knows what'll happen if that thing gets out.",
    "This creature is capable of flight. It'll be hard to track it if it gets out.",
    "Beware of those large cannons!",
    "The air force is now carrying out plans to chase after the unidentified lifeform. We'll guide it to an area where anti-aircraft guns are waiting and destroy it.",
    "W-What is going on!?",
    "I looked over the materials. We're scraping together whatever anti-aircraft guns we can get.",
    "戦車兵63-1",
    "Let's show them what these anti-aircraft guns can do.",
    "Let's get to work then.",
    "戦車兵63-2",
    "戦車兵63-3",
    "兵士11-6",
    "It can just shrug off bullets?!",
    "Take your positions.",
    "戦車隊隊長63-1",
    "Deploy.",
    "Would you like to decrease the difficulty level?",
    "All units, get some distance.",
    "This level has a clear rate of 20%. You are a talented player.",
    "Message from the air force. They're successfully leading the unidentified lifeform. It's coming this way.",
    "Take your positions!",
    "Tanks will provide cover!",
    "Anti-aircraft guns, hold back until we're done taking care of the monsters.",
    "For a new recruit, you handle yourself pretty good.",
    "It's really a monster that far overshadows Erginus.",
    "Another problem is its range of action. It seems to be able to fly for nearly a day straight. While Erginus is a terrifying creature, it could only go so far. It didn't have the power to destroy all of humanity. But if it could fly...",
    "We need to evacuate! Come with me! I'll take you to somewhere safe.",
    "Don't hurt yourself. You should get out.",
    "Target inbound.",
    "The unidentified lifeform is coming!",
    "Here it is! It's getting closer!",
    "Forget about a bird, this thing is bigger than a whale!",
    "We're gonna get blown away!",
    "We're gonna die just from being close to it!",
    "隊長63-1",
    "Ground unit here. Attacking from the ground will be difficult. The force of the wind is keeping us at a distance.",
    "兵士63-8",
    "It's not working!",
    "Don't be afraid! We have anti-aircraft guns! I know we'll be able to down it!",
    "Calm down! Kill them all!",
    "兵士63-12",
    "コードＮです。ベース２２８に部隊を集めてください。",
    "It's showing no signs of tiring! It just keeps on flying!",
    "兵士63-13",
    "Don't get stung by it! There's no way you can survive.",
    "Did you think we'd get scared over a little bit of fire-breathing?!",
    "I don't care what kind of monster you are, nothing can withstand this level of shelling.",
    "Its ability is uncanny...",
    "The latest gun model. It's for personal use, but it's 10 times powerful than a EMC.",
    "What the hell?! We're firing more than just machine guns here!",
    "戦車兵63-7",
    "兵士625",
    "兵士45",
    "This has enough power to break a building to pieces in seconds. How's it shrugging us off?!",
    "This creature is twice the size of Erginus. How can it be that big and still fly?",
    "Erginus may have been a threat, but its movements were predictable and it could only go so far. That's why the damage it caused was limited, but if we're dealing with something that can fly...",
    "We're naming this new creature the Siren.",
    "This is Wing Diver 4. We will start the attack.",
    "兵士946",
    "Air force will now be attacking.",
    "Stop the invaders!",
    "Coming in 3... 2... 1...",
    "It's still alive. I can't believe this thing.",
    "兵士63-14",
    "兵士107-2",
    "We're running!",
    "All systems go.",
    "It can't be! That Glaukos must be attracted to the scent of blood.",
    "兵士63-15",
    "We did it! We fought it off!",
    "兵士63-16",
    "If they were able to create a monster that could breed underground it would be a horrific threat.",
    "I have information on the Siren. Other members of this species have been confirmed in locations around the world. We're currently tracking eight in total.",
    "This must mean that the Primer birthed multiple Sirens simultaneously. Seems like something they'd do.",
    "According to information from the air force, multiple Sirens are heading to the sea, where they continue to fly overhead.",
    "They're trying to pull something. We have to destroy them before they can do it.",
    "ウイングダイバー兵士23",
    "Air force information states that Scylla are gathering around the Sirens flying above the sea. The two species may somehow be linked to one another.",
    "Two different species working together to increase their likelihood of survival. It may be some kind of symbiotic relationship.",
    "Multiple Anchors spotted.",
    "This operation is about to be over.",
    "Its strength has nearly run out. Just a bit more.",
    "The Primer are planning to use this as a teleportation base. We're putting a stop to their plans.",
    "Monsters are coming out of the base!",
    "The enemy forces are already coming together. Now's our only chance.",
    "I can't entrust this mission to anyone else.",
    "We're the only ones who can fight these High Mobility Androids.",
    "We're ridiculously outmatched. It's fine if you want to run.",
    "The walls of light spread out in a dome-like shape. We won't be able to destroy any Anchors protected by those walls, so we need to destroy the Shield Bearers first.",
    "The walls of light are energy barriers with special properties. They block our attacks, but allow enemy attacks through. They're able to attack from safety so long as they're behind a wall.",
    "Shield Bearer down.",
    "Anchor successfully destroyed.",
    "兵士53-1",
    "Green monsters are coming!",
    "兵士53-2",
    "兵士53-3",
    "Kruuls! Kruuls are coming!",
    "兵士53-4",
    "兵士53-5",
    "Aliens are coming out!",
    "We are out of options. We are counting on you.",
    "Mobile base is picking up speed. It looks like they're coming this way.",
    "This is Nix 1. So that's Archelus? Leave it to us.",
    "A brand new unit. So they're finally being used in battle.",
    "Even if we have a railgun, who knows if we can pierce the armor of a mobile base... What an awful enemy to be up against.",
    "Enemy mobile base is approaching.",
    "Almost ready, but they're already headed right in front of us.",
    "Dammit! Are we not going to make it in time?",
    "A walking base!",
    "Look, drones! Drones are coming out of the base!",
    "戦車搭乗員53-1",
    "You are in no danger.",
    "Civilian, you are stronger and braver than anyone else. You know what to do, right?",
    "A perfect battlefield for a Grim Reaper.",
    "Snipers, provide cover for units in combat.",
    "A unit of reinforcements is here, rendezvous with them.",
    "レールガン搭乗員53-1",
    "Watch your surroundings.",
    "There's a mobile base present.",
    "It seems that a railgun can't pierce the armor of a mobile base. Retreat is recommended.",
    "Commencing retreat. Infantry, move back. Heavy tanks, move in front of that mobile fortress to create a wall and block off the enemy.",
    "重戦車搭乗員53-1",
    "Stand your ground. The more time we can buy, the more of our allies survive.",
    "So these are our coffins, huh? Well, better not let my death be in vain.",
    "We'll die if we go.",
    "You want to rescue the heavy tanks? Interesting.",
    "What are you doing?! You won't last for long, hurry up and run!",
    "You've bought more than enough time! We'll cover you! Hurry!",
    "You want to act as a shield for heavy tanks? Ridiculous. You'll get yourselves killed!",
    "Don't tell me you've come to rescue some heavy tanks.",
    "The operation is over! Pull back!",
    "The aliens seemed to be communicating with each other. Probably requesting for backup. Stay alert.",
    "Understood. You ought to hurry up and run too.",
    "We'll provide cover! Go!",
    "Run! We'll cover for you!",
    "Monsters are coming out from the teleportation device!",
    "This is where I die. Don't get in my way.",
    "You've still got more work for me? Fine, then. But you'd better not die either.",
    "Let's hit them where it hurts just one more time.",
    "We can't make contact with the ground. We are isolated.",
    "If we time it right, we could attack it while it's sleeping.",
    "You want to keep going?",
    "Spriggans, we're providing support.",
    "Exploit your territorial advantage. Their movement should be limited there.",
    "Hey! What do you think you're doing?!",
    "Sniper team, commencing operation.",
    "There's no way to pierce that gold armor. It's impossible.",
    "Damned thing is firing on us!",
    "They're all in different colors too. It looks like they're all different types.",
    "Ready!",
    "The laser cannons are dangerous. Destroy them.",
    "We should be able to at least destroy some guns. Attack them!",
    "Attack the cannons!",
    "斥候X9-90",
    "We really destroyed the cannons!",
    "兵士54-2",
    "We couldn't hurt it with airstrikes and missiles at the time.",
    "Drones! They're coming from the base!",
    "W-we got 'em!",
    "We've dealt damage to the mobile base!",
    "As threatening as the base's mobility is, I guess that's also its weakness. There are sections at the bottom that aren't armored.",
    "There's a hatch at the bottom! Wait for it to open, then attack!",
    "We're surrounded!",
    "They really want to take down the mobile base!",
    "The mobile base is pulling back.",
    "It's running away! We've won!",
    "The main unit of the enemy's forces is approaching. Pull back at once.",
    "The base didn't run away. It just pulled back because the main unit has arrived.",
    "Hurry! We're retreating!",
    "So that's what a top warrior can do!",
    "斥候X9-2",
    "It really is bad news this time.",
    "The battle lines are starting to crumble. They're going to rush in and attack.",
    "Run. You need to survive.",
    "兵士54-3",
    "They've caught up to us!",
    "Damn! If only I had a Blazer in my hand...",
    "兵士54-4",
    "兵士54-5",
    "Hurry! Run!",
    "兵士54-6",
    "斥候54-1",
    "斥候54-2",
    "Elite Drones!",
    "There's no signal in the area. Looks like the retreat has been delayed.",
    "I'm just doing my job. After all, I'm a strategic support AI that manages all incoming intelligence.",
    "To return to our territory, we must pass through this area.",
    "Enemy annihilated.",
    "We need to clear this mountain of enemies so that we can safely make our retreat. Let's come up with a strategy while we wait for backup.",
    "There are red flyers. A horrific subspecies of fighting monster.",
    "Fighting them means you have a death wish.",
    "Stay aware of the wall of light. It intercepts our attacks but lets enemy attacks pass through. If it goes up, attacks will only go one way.",
    "To destroy a shield bearer, the wall of light must be penetrated. A human could break through.",
    "Shield bearer destroyed.",
    "There's an enemy on the retreat path. What's going on?",
    "兵士729",
    "They can't fight much more without backup...",
    "Combat underway. Reinforce the line. Hurry.",
    "Seems like there's a battle underway.",
    "There they are! Damn! We've gotta help them!",
    "They took on this many enemies? Hurry, back them up!",
    "You're always getting into these crazy battles.",
    "We're here. Providing backup.",
    "It's them, right?",
    "兵士879",
    "It doesn't matter if we break formation. Let's form a line and show them what we've got.",
    "Provide reinforcements. Hurry.",
    "Taking all the kills for yourself? That's no fair!",
    "Flyer nest neutralized.",
    "Half of the enemies have been destroyed.",
    "Taking on that many enemies...it's madness.",
    "We managed to eliminate the enemies blocking our way. This is a huge win for us. I can't believe it.",
    "ウイングダイバー隊長57-1",
    "The teleportation ship is just ahead.",
    "The teleportation ships are docked in this area.",
    "Obliterate every ship at all costs.",
    "Something's falling from the sky!",
    "It's a Kruul. It must have come to rescue the teleportation ship.",
    "Now we can say goodbye to the monsters.",
    "Capsules incoming. The enemy's evolved ships are releasing capsules.",
    "Alien landing ship approaching!",
    "Aliens have landed.",
    "Monsters don't breed underground. Did the aliens carry them here?",
    "That type of alien wears armor.",
    "This is Scout. Different types of monsters are coming out from those giant teleport anchors.",
    "We think it's a unit sent to rescue the teleportation ships.",
    "This must be what they were looking for.",
    "Came to defend the teleportation ships, huh? Well, they're too late.",
    "We've shot down a teleportation ship.",
    "Teleportation ship destroyed.",
    "We can't let them die. They're irreplaceable. Let's go.",
    "Can't we be more careful? This is gonna get us killed.",
    "隊長41",
    "Thank you.",
    "Look at them! We have no chance at all!",
    "隊長58-1",
    "Estimated location is Sector 1-8. That's the spot. That's where it landed.",
    "We now know that there are various monster species. Even those that look similar can have different abilities. Make note of their size.",
    "兵士58-1",
    "Look! A ball of fire!",
    "Can you open the shutters?",
    "兵士58-2",
    "兵士58-3",
    "Ah, great! Why did it have to drop right where I am?",
    "Not necessarily, but if you notice anything irregular, report back.",
    "Huh?",
    "It's not just here. The same activity has been detected in three places. And there's likely more to come.",
    "No way.",
    "We need to take it out. Let's do this.",
    "It's walking on top of the buildings!",
    "Grim Reaper here, we've confirmed our prey.",
    "Aim for the cannons on its legs.",
    "兵士687",
    "Enemy weaponry dropping in!",
    "More incoming!",
    "KG6 is headed your way. Wait it out.",
    "隊長58-2",
    "So this is the enemy war machine.",
    "There're monsters out from holes!",
    "Hold them off until KG6 gets here.",
    "It fires missiles from the cannons on its legs.",
    "Now we can complete our mission without taking gunfire from the base.",
    "Unidentified objects incoming!",
    "Damn it! There are so many of them!",
    "Where the hell is KG6?!",
    "The machine guns just arrived. Infantry, fall back behind the tanks.",

    "Listen, everyone.",
    "Enemy robots dropping in!",
    "There are far more robots than we anticipated.",
    "Machine guns, continue firing. Infantry, defend Kepler.",
    "斥候58-9",
    "Additional enemy robots incoming!",
    "This way, hurry up.",
    "斥候58-10",
    "Either waiting for reinforcements or retreating will take too long. Our hands are tied.",
    "War machine destroyed.",
    "We've called the Wing Divers. They will be here any minute.",
    "...Please hold your thoughts. Our men are getting massacred.",
    "Enemy destroyed.",
    "Another robot down!",
    "Another destroyed!",
    "Our troops were the only ones who won. We need to go and reinforce the other areas immediately.",
    "If this place was destroyed...the situation would have been hopeless. Thank you.",
    "And they're enormous.",

    "High mobility Android spotted.",

    "The enemy force is even larger than expected.",
    "Exterminators are on the way. Just hold on.",
    "Of course the extermination team is late again!",
    "BMX10!",
    "Of course those exterminators get a fun new toy to play with.",
    "Extermination Team here. Enemy vanguard has been defeated.",
    "Enemy ships spotted. Enemy unit approaching. Continue to engage.",
    "They don't look like humans at all!",
    "Roger that. Time to show these aliens who's boss.",
    "The Aggressive Aliens are Gammas!",
    "Enemy dropships approaching.",
    "They're attacking our men!",
    "Whoever they are, I'm just glad they're on our side.",

    "兵士107-9",
    "Aliens incoming. Lots of them.",
    "This is Scout. We have confirmed a landing ship fleet.",
    "Enemies are being dropped in!",
    "Exterminators, regroup.",
    "Now do you see what a Proteus can do, you damned aliens?",
    "You'll have to bring an Erginus-class monster if you want to take us down.",
    "How big is the alien army?",
    "You'll have to bring an Archelus-class monster if you want to take us down.",
    "Attention everyone, this is the Chief Commander. The alien attack is still under way. The entire Earth has become a battlefield, and people everywhere are in harm's way. Our attack against the alien spaceship remains ineffective, and there is nothing we can do for now. But EDF always prevails, and until we can launch a full-fledged counter strike, I hope the ground units can keep exterminating the monsters and protect our citizens. This is a tough war, but I expect all of us to fight bravely. Do not forget we have defenseless citizens depending on us. We are not only on the front line, we are also the last line of defense.",
    "You'll have to bring a real monster if you want to take us down.",
    "The scale of the enemy unit is greater than our intel indicated, but we can't let them through. Hold them at bay until reinforcements arrive.",
    "You are a civilian, aren't you?",
    "The shield can be overwhelmed. If it takes enough attacks, it will eventually shut down.",
    "Multiple flyers approaching!",
    "Android Grenadiers!",
    "They have too many grenadiers! They'll blow the whole town to pieces!",

    "By the way, what is that weapon? Do we need it for our mission? It could be dangerous. Leave it.",
    "A model gun? Why'd you bring that?",
    "Is that a toy? Why did you bring it here?",
    "Don't just start pointing that thing around.",

    "This way.",

    "That's a d-dead body...",
    "I wonder what will happen.",
    "Unfortunately, we need to prioritize the living right now. Let's move.",
    "Let's go. There should be powered exoskeletons in that hangar.",
    "C'mon. We're headed to the hangar.",
    "Let's go. We need weapons.",
    "What's going on? And what the hell are those monsters? How many are there?",
    "Hey! Wait!",
    "兵士1215",
    "It's not safe. After them!",
    "We have to go through here? What's the plan?",
    "These things are a threat. Shoot them!",
    "I've never seen anything like that before.",
    "Did those things escape from the zoo? There were so many of them...",
    "兵士1197",
    "Their numbers are insane!",
    "Some kind of incident must've occurred at the zoo. And the monsters they were keeping all got out!",
    "The monsters from the pylon have already laid an egg.",
    "This was no zoo incident. We're being attacked!",
    "You saved us. You're a real hero.",
    "Why is it shaking like this?",
    "We can't do this anymore!!!",
    "Looks like the equipment's ready. Let's go.",
    "Of course not. They're just a regular person.",
    "The winged aliens keep coming.",
    "I guess you're not a normal citizen after all.",
    "Again. Let's go after them.",
    "Looks like they're headed somewhere.",
    "We don't know where they're going, but this is bad. There are monsters everywhere.",
    "There should be a hangar with exoskeletons up ahead.",
    "The sergeant has a license.",
    "The exoskeleton!",
    "It's broken!",
    "Shit! We need to head above ground.",
    "Wait. Gunfire.",

    "This must be our destination.",
    "Do we really need this thing?",
    "You passed.",

    "I know the code. I helped deliver vehicles here.",
    "To activate it, you need to enter a complex code.",
    "Wait, you know the activation sequence?!",
    "How do you know the activation sequence?!",
    "They need this?",
    "Okay. There's a lift to the surface. Let's send Barga up.",
    "We'll head up to the surface, too.",
    "Wow! What a display!",

    "兵士223",
    "It pierced straight into the ground! What in the world?!",
    "A giant spacecraft-like object was discovered under the surface of the moon. An eleventh Mothership. It's likely their command module. We've found our enemy's weakness at last. We can win this battle if only we could destroy it, but humanity doesn't have the power to do that right now.",
    "兵士117-9",
    "The fall didn't break it. It's some kind of device!",
    "There's more of them!",
    "隊長117-2",
    "Aliens spotted.",
    "Sergeant, do you hear me? We have info about the flying saucers.",
    "You civilians shouldn't be here! Run!",
    "隊長78",
    "What the hell are they thinking?",
    "The top of the pylon is its weak spot. The upper part. Shoot the shining area!",
    "It was like they already knew how to destroy the pylons.",

    "If we destroy the command ship, it will turn the tide. Hurry! Destroy it before they gather up.",
    "Whoa! That enemy weapon just got destroyed!",
    "They're coming from above! Enemies coming from the sky!",
    "Back up the citizens!",
    "We can't hide behind civilians! Let's go!",

    "EDF! EDF!",
    "They will crash down here!",
    "We're going in, too. Form up with those citizens.",
    "It's coming this way!",
    "Opening the hatch. The hatch will now open.",
    "Be careful. Back away from the hatch.",
    "Yes. By the book. Safety first.",
    "These monsters will be called \"Aggressors species γ\" from now on. The species γ is a very tough opponent. Make sure to stay alert when encountering them.",
    "The lift is moving!",
    "Destroy the ones who came to destroy us.",
    "It's Barga!",
    "H-help me!",
    "It's all right. We'll get you out.",
    "Does he really mean to pilot that thing?",
    "I can't believe how many of them you took down.",
    "Can I go home?",
    "I've heard the rumors. I'm counting on you.",
    "Fear nothing, including those monster freaks!",
    "Preparations are complete. However...",
    "Currently in transit. We will arrive momentarily.",
    "We're prepared to die. Just use us as your cover!",
    "You're telling me we can use that thing? It's just a mobile crane.",
    "It seems the nest is going deeper.. Let's make sure it's safe around here.",
    "The Gigantic Unloader Barga is ready for deployment.",
    "An enormous amount of monsters are coming out from the Giant Teleportation Anchor.",
    "Cleared to board.",
    "Erginus’ regenerative abilities are extraordinary— even explosives won't affect it. So we aim to pulverize it in one swoop by hitting it with a similarly massive object.",
    "Tanks, cover the Barga.",
    "Calm down! Keep it together!",
    "Nice. Who would have thought that we could use a crane like this?!",
    "Destroy the Teleportation Anchors!",
    "ウイングダイバー隊長119-1",
    "We've spotted multiple flyers in the cave.",
    "I heard that flyers hate enclosed spaces like this.",
    "As you may know, there's a dangerous creature called the human populating the outside. Perhaps the flyers are looking for a place safe to hide from us.",
    "We haven't heard from Team 2. They took a different route to get in.",
    "Flyers can move in the dark, too. Keep your guards up.",
    "We can't take advantage of the mobility of the Wing Divers in these caves. It's a field disadvantage.",
    "Damn you, monsters! We'll be back!",
    "That applies to the enemy, too. The bigger they are, the more of a disadvantage they have.",
    "We're breaking through below the Mothership.",
    "It's so dark in here. I'm getting freaked out.",
    "Don't depend on your sight. Listen to the darkness.",
    "Flyers!",
    "There's a huge, open space!",
    "There are so many of them! They have a nest!",
    "Another cavern!",
    "Take a good look. The battle is lopsided. We might get wiped out too.",
    "Team 2, here. We're in too deep. Team 1 got wiped out.",
    "We're engaging the flyers! Help us!",
    "We don't have many troops, but we have someone we can depend on. Hang on.",
    "Team 2 needs reinforcements!",
    "We can't just leave, now. We need to keep investigating.",
    "There seems to be a path toward the bottom of the cave. Let's go.",
    "Down there. There's a path.",
    "Feel that? The air is vibrating!",
    "Artillery unit will open fire right away.",
    "I hear wings flapping and...something's rumbling. It's a huge horde of them!",
    "A cavern!",
    "There are small nests in the surrounding area, too. I've never seen nesting grounds this large.",
    "It's okay. I want to provide as much support as possible.",
    "I've seen the footage. But I can't believe a nest of that scale exists underground.",
    "Commencing extermination!",
    "Don't push it. Our mission is to collect information.",
    "That thing's huge!",
    "Fire! Fire! Annihilate them!",
    "So they have reached Europe too?",

    "Good. This is our target destination.",

    "If we attack the huge nest first, they'll swarm us. Be careful.",
    "If we pull this off, we'll be in the history books. Let's do this thing.",
    "Begin the final phase. Destroy the flyer nest.",
    "Target the small nests!",
    "Leave the giant nest for later! Start with the small ones!",
    "Aliens are descending!",
    "The huge nest has been shot!",
    "The giant nest was hit!",
    "Oh, shit! Monsters are swarming out of the giant nest!",
    "Monsters incoming! It's because we disturbed the big nest!",

    "Destroy the aliens. Let's go.",
    "Thousands of years? They've been here on earth so long ago?",
    "That thing's a freak. We can't go up against something like that.",
    "We should call in our air forces.",
    "If we catch it off guard, we can defeat it. Come on!",
    "Don't act alone. We fight together.",
    "Cast off your fear. Fear will only disorient you.",
    "What the hell is the Mothership trying to do?",
    "When the shield turns black, change where you're aiming and hit the enemy's main body.",
    "Don't just aim at the same spot. Once the shield is down, change where you're aiming.",
    "We need to stop both. Shoot those shields up!",
    "This alien has powerful weapons. It can fire beams for an extended period of time, and it changes its target after firing.",
    "Enemy ship majorly damaged.",

    "Flyers must hatch from eggs.",
    "They may look similar to aliens, but they're actually completely different creatures.",
    "They're the same as monsters. Aliens are using these flyers as weapons.",
    "There are countless larvae born. Yet through natural selection from the environment and predators, only the strong survive and grow to maturity.",
    "So these aliens are serious about moving to this planet.",
    "Then we have no choice but to wipe them out. If we let them mature, they'll become a threat to humanity.",
    "The situation has become dire.",
    "Those things plan on breeding here.",
    "All right. We must destroy these eggs!",
    "You've got backup. Rendezvous with them.",
    "There are eggs all over the city!",
    "The citizens were evacuated when the flyers attacked. Extermination is our primary objective.",
    "Drones approaching.",
    "Shoot the drones down.",
    "They've gone this far just to defend the flyers... This breeding ground must be extremely important to the Primers.",
    "Like any monster, they require certain conditions to breed. If we can eradicate the enemy here, we may be able to stop the flyers from multiplying.",
    "Drones approaching!",
    "I think it was nothing more than a chance malfunction. It won't be happening a second time, but we can recreate the first time if we're in the same place at the same moment. The same chance malfunction will take place, because that's how it's set up to happen.",

    "I read your report. Technology that allows you to navigate time, you say.",

    "...Still not enough data, then...",
    "I can't bring anything with me. Memorize it. You have to memorize it...",
    "Major? I'd like to propose an operation. I've sent you the files just now.",

    "It's a new Flying Aggressor variant!",
    "I'm not getting any scientists. We're going to move the world, which means getting the people in it who have real power.",
    "We're mostly on the same timeline as before, but there seem to be slight differences. Be careful.",
    "Let's meet at the usual spot. Don't die on me.",
    "The situation gets worse the more that history is changed. This is the result of our enemies constantly altering history, but we can't even figure out how they're changing it.",
    "The accident must have been a miracle brought about by countless coincidences. It's the kind of thing that shouldn't happen a second time, but we know how to make it happen once more. Or rather...it hasn't happened yet, but it's going to. The accident takes place two weeks from now, and in that moment on that day, we're going to cause it by attacking the machine.",
    "I guess you're tired of hearing this explanation...but I still have to give it. I feel so anxious. Will we really be able to recreate it...?",
    "The accident takes place a week from now. In that moment on that day, we'll attack the time machine, the same accident will occur, and time will be rewound. Time won't proceed any further so long as we keep doing this. We'll have essentially trapped the Primer in a cage of time. It doesn't matter how strong they are, the day they're victorious will never come so long as time doesn't move forward.",
    "That said, they continue to revise history. It seems they keep on changing the situation just as we keep returning to the past. At some point, it's going to get so bad that there's nothing we can do about it. Time won't rewind if we die before the day of the accident, and when that happens, humanity is done for.",
    "It worked. I still have my memories.",
    "兵士140",
    "...It would've been easier on me if I'd lost them, though.",
    "Thank you for being there for me. Now I can know for sure that this isn't all a delusion. I would've thought that I was going crazy if I was the only one.",
    "But even so... It may be the case that humanity can only survive within this rewound time at this point. No matter how many times they're killed, I suppose it's better than disappearing for good.",
    "That said, I can't keep doing this. I've seen my wife die so many times now.",
    "It worked. I remember everything.",
    "Enemy fleet is approaching!",
    "An enemy fleet? There's nothing about this unit in the reports. What's going on...?",
    "An enemy fleet is coming.",
    "It's a massive fleet. Why did they pick this area...?",
    "Jackpot. Our wild gamble has actually paid off. This is the spot the enemies are after.",
    "That fleet was sent in order to alter history. We can prevent it from being changed if we can destroy them.",
    "Humanity's survival depends on this battle. Please, we're counting on you.",
    "We have to find a solution! This...this is our final opportunity!",
    "Enemies spotted! Large-scale fleet!",

    "Enemy ships are coming. Keep your eyes on the sky.",
    "You're here. We couldn't be any luckier than this. No... After repeating the same moments again and again, we've at last earned this coincidence.",
    "I thought the enemy would go after this place. Guess I was right.",
    "Attack the nest.",

    "We won... This victory is a major one.",
    "You're making me realize that we still have hope.",
    "We were in a hopeless situation. Everyone had given up. But I...",
    "You're always able to survive... And I mean that in a good way.",
    "This is such an absurd result... What do I even write in my report?",
    "I think this goes without saying now, but it seems my theory was correct.",

    "Okay, EMC it is.",

    "This is the same history as our own. Nothing has changed.",
    "Its route changes all the time. It's hard to predict.",
    "Everyone was convinced that the Primer had come from space, but that's not it. They came from the future. It's why they suddenly appeared above orbit, breaking the barriers of time.",
    "It really is just like the history that we know. The Primer should be altering the timeline. But when did it happen, and how?",
    "We've discovered the enemy's command module, but all we can do is look at it. Humanity is so powerless.",
    "The enemy's armor is far too thick!",
    "The Primer are able to freely move throughout time. In that case, they should easily be able to accomplish their goals by either going after humanity during primitive times, or at least by attacking humanity before the EDF is formed. So why are they so fixated on this era? What's the reason?",
    "A simultaneous worldwide attack. But it's obvious how much weaker we are than them. It'll be a hopeless battle.",
    "There's meaning in simply acting here and now! We have to win, no matter the price we pay.",
    "兵士682",
    "We're doing anything we can to raise our chances of success even a bit. Humanity's fate is riding on this operation.",
    "Rangers, provide cover for units in combat.",

    "So it went exactly as he planned, huh.",
    "兵士X8-1",
    "If the monsters really are from Earth...that would require a hundred thousand years of evolution. This is only a theory, but human civilization won't survive for a hundred thousand years. Earth...belongs to the monsters then.",
    "Humanity has long fallen a hundred thousand years in the future. Likely caused by environmental pollution or nuclear war. A number of seeds were able to survive in that contaminated environment, and after many cycles of evolution and selection, the monsters won out in the end. It's a complete shock. Humanity will fall within the next hundred thousand years even without the Primer attacking.",
    "Genetic investigation has made clear that it's not just the monsters. Even the aliens we encountered at the beginning have the same hallmarks in their DNA. In other words, the green aliens are also creatures from a distant future Earth. A new form of intelligent life, born in a planet of monsters. That, or they may be what humanity mutates into in the future.",
    "The Primer descended upon a future Earth to capture the monsters and aliens. If we go with this theory...that means the Primer came from a hundred thousand years in the future. I'd thought their time machine could only change history on a level of ten or so years, but in reality, it's what they use for transportation. The Primer were born far in the future, when humanity has already fallen. They're travelers who have gone back in time by a dizzying number of years.",
    "What?! This wasn't mentioned in any of the reports. What the hell is happening?",
    "A journey spanning a hundred thousand years. That can't be easy for anything, even the Primer. Why go to all this trouble to attack humanity? What exactly could it be...?",
    "There are people who believe that there's great meaning in the reason why the Primer want to eliminate humanity.",
    "Perhaps Earthlings are just that terrifying to them.",

    "Maybe think about how you're gonna survive first!",
    "It's no joke if you get spit on. Must kill them before they get us!",
    "So, they use monsters as their weapons. The cruelest and most brutal weapons imaginable.",
    "I'll open the blast door now. Back off.",
    "Head to the ground surface. Follow me.",
    "If you don't fight, you will become their food.",
    "I am ready to fight, but not against so many...",
    "Roger. Moving up.",

    "Air raid starting now.",
    "We will be safe when we reach the surface. Let's go.",
    "I'm opening the blast door now.",
    "Hold on, sergeant. I need some mental preparation.",
    "Blue means alert mode. Red means combat mode.",
    "I'm sure there are tons of monsters on the other side of the door.",
    "Ready? I'm unlocking it now.",
    "Huh? What the...",
    "Why isn't there any response from the ground force?",
    "Maybe something happened.",
    "You handled yourself pretty well back there for a civilian.",
    "This is Scout. Aliens have started moving. The number of aliens that occupy the city is decreasing.",
    "You've got what it takes to be a soldier. Wanna join us?",
    "The drones are defending the breeding grounds. Shoot them down, and take them out along with the monsters.",
    "We are close to the surface now.",
    "The Rescue Team must be waiting on the surface. We will be safe once we get out from here.",
    "Maybe the monsters are biological weapons created by another nation.",
    "No way! It's likely that there are monsters on the other side.",
    "Open the blast door!",
    "Nothing to fear! Exterminate them all!",
    "Hey, civilian. That was quite impressive.",
    "After we get out, visit the army recruiter. He will help you with the paperwork.",
    "This is the exit. We can meet up with our unit.",
    "Don't worry, civilian, we're safe now.",

    "So far, the identity of the flying objects remains unclear as governments worldwide deny involvement. And it hasn't been confirmed whether other organizations are involved. Although the government promised to clarify the situation, the current state is in chaos for authorities in question so the situation remains obscure. ***?

    "I see aliens walking on our streets. The urban area is not safe anymore. Everybody is in hiding, but we don't know what to do. Please help us.",

    "More flying saucers incoming!",
    "T-There are too many of them!",
    "We analyzed their pattern of action. We think that these weapons are autonomous battle drones, and I am afraid their targets are... humans.",
    "Unmanned killing weapons, huh?",
    "There should be laws against the use of battle drones.",
    "That's a large Gamma!",
    "Which freaking country sent those things?",

    "2 enemies left.",
    "So far, no substantial information about the flying objects could be obtained. Governments of all countries are still denying any sort of involvement. However, there are only a limited number of forces that can perform such a large-scale attack. In order to find out the truth, the suspected parties should be closely monitored; investigations ought to be pursued and appropriate enforcement actions taken. But currently all measures are being hindered by the current situation.",
    "This is Strategic Command Headquarters.",
    "Flying saucers spotted!",
    "What is the Air Force doing?",
    "Ordinary terrorists can't possibly create such weapons. The enemy seems to be a powerful country.",

    "We'd better evacuate.",

    "This is the Strategic Intelligence Division. Flying saucers are unmanned drones, meaning that we can still defeat them, even if they outnumber us.",
    "Tell me how.",
    "The color of the drone is the key. A blue drone is in alert mode and is presumed to be harmless. So the drones that glow in blue are not dangerous.",
    "If we can mass produce it, it may change the tides of war.",
    "It'll be the end of you if you're on your own.",
    "But under certain circumstances, the drones will turn red. Red Color Drones are in Combat Mode. They are killing machines that can trace and kill their targets.",
    "Finish Erginus with airstrikes. EMC stand by just in case.",
    "The drones in this area are all in alert mode. Don't fight all drones at once. Lure a few of them each time, and then destroy them one by one.",
    "After some detailed analysis, we have figured out the conditions in which the alert mode switches to combat mode. There are three conditions:",
    "First, humans reach closest point of approach distance.",
    "Second, they are attacked.",
    "It's Archelus!",
    "Third, when a drone is hit, nearby drones will turn into combat mode. That means, the drone that was hit will inform the drones around it about the enemy.",

    "兵士85",
    "No, you are wrong. Monsters are everywhere in the world, not just here.",
    "This is the Strategic Intelligence Division. The black monsters we encountered before will be called 'α' from now on. The ones that shoot threads will be called 'β'.",
    "Although the species β monsters are slow, they can unleash threads with acid, so they are very dangerous.",

    "We know. The monsters are everywhere.",

    "Damn! Defeat all monsters!",
    "Take down the monsters! Advance!",
    "Landers flying in.",
    "Attention, everyone. This is the Chief Commander. We were ambushed by the enemy and suffered great loss. The ravages of war have spread all over the world, and are even getting more serious. It is unfortunate that we were heavily stricken by the enemy at our first battle, but we are not lost yet. The most urgent matter at hand, is that our people are still in danger. We must pull ourselves together, and start our counterattack. The EDF shall rise again. And the time is now.",
    "Oh no! We are surrounded!",
    "Are these the monsters that were dropped before? Are they all lurking underground?",
    "Looks like I was saved by the newbie.",

    "Pylons are being dropped. Stay alert.",
    "It's the monsters that shoot threads!",
    "It's species β and they are coming!",
    "We can't leave the pylon like that. Destroy it before it causes more casualties!",
    "Pylons coming down!",
    "Pylons again!",
    "And they have deployed thousands of them. This might really be the end of the humankind.",
    "The enemy's plan is to fill the city with monsters, but we won't let that happen. Destroy the pylons and stop the enemy's plan!",
    "Earlier today, EDF made a shocking announcement. According to EDF, the flying objects all around the world are spaceships of an extraterrestrial civilization. EDF also made the radar records public. The data showed the moment when numerous flying objects showed up on the Earth's orbit. The data record was so shocking that everyone at the press conference, including journalists, were speechless. Now journalists from all around the world are crowding at EDF Headquarters, and it's chaotic on the scene.",
    "Civilian, I promise I'll take you to a safe place.",
    "Enough with the comforting.",
    "Sergeant, assign troops to protect the civilians. Take them to safety.",
    "I'll take you to a safe place this time for sure.",

    "This nest is enormous!",

    "Here they come again!",
    "隊長3",
    "The weapons of the red monsters are their fang! Shoot them dead before they get closer!",

    "Hey, did you hear that?",
    "There's nowhere safe. Too bad.",
    "C'mon. We all get it in a situation like this.",
    "A troop of large flying saucers is about to fly over this area. Exterminate the monsters being deployed.",

    "Try dodging that! Dumbass!",
    "Damn! Our attacks were ineffective!",
    "This is special newsflash. The aliens dispatched infantry units to Europe, but the EDF was sent in to engage the enemy, and secured a victory.",
    "They didn't dodge because there's no need.",
    "They keep dropping monsters!",
    "Our targets are huge. You can't miss.",
    "Mother Monster defeated.",
    "If we can't find a way to penetrate the golden armor, mankind is lost.",
    "At least take down the monsters!",
    "If we can't shoot down the large flying saucers, the monsters will keep multiplying.",
    "Guess we have to put our lives at risk for this one.",
    "This is a war situation report. Although the EDF caused tremendous damage to the aliens, the battle is still continuing. We have the upper hand. Please do not be influenced by rumors. Stay calm, and don't panic.  There will be evacuation alarms in areas where evacuation is required. In order to act rapidly in case of evacuation, please start preparing your basic necessities, and be ready.",
    "Granted.",
    "The visitors from outer space have been dubbed 'Primers' by EDF. Since we are at war, negotiation attempts have ended. The EDF has been criticized for its lack of effort in keeping the door to dialogue with the visitors open. It may  not be the best policy to give up on peace talks at the initial stage. Shouldn't we continue to seek dialogue with Primers?",
    "Obviously the flying saucers are dropping monsters that are larger than their own mass. They are probably equipped with the same teleportation device used by the pylons.",
    "Does this technology teleport objects? That's amazing!",
    "We will call the enemy's transporting technology 'teleportation' from now on.",
    "If you want to go home, then we have to take it back from those aliens.",
    "There are flying saucers everywhere.",

    "There are too many of them. If they all start deploying monsters, we won't be able to kill them all!",

    "What the hell is the air force doing?",
    "Hooligan cannons are still in experimental stage and can't fire consecutively. We have to shut them down for now.",

    "That is not the problem.",
    "This is a war situation report. In order to stop the enemy from dropping monsters, EDF launched attacks against the large flying saucers, and damaged them successfully.

    "It's too dangerous!",
    "I can't believe we are going under the transportation ships!",

    "That golden armor is unbreakable.",
    "We've damaged the base successfully.",
    "Good. These attacks are effective.",
    "It's the first time we successfully destroyed a base. The data will be sent to the EDF headquarter.",
    "Goddamn illegal aliens!",
    "兵士538",
    "If this keeps up, we'll become the indigenous peoples!",
    "兵士539",
    "An \"alien\" rights problem. I didn't see THAT coming.",
    "The enemy is gearing up for a large-scale airborne operation, dropping off aliens worldwide. They might launch some larger attacks in the future. Now we're at the crossroad. This war might be coming to a conclusion soon.",
    "Bastards. Are they trying to finish us off?",
    "The aliens are approaching Beijing.",
    "Taking heavy casualties!",
    "5000 aliens are closing in on Beijing. We'll round up our forces to beat them in the suburbs of Beijing.",
    "Operation name: Crossroad. This will be the battle to determine the fate of humanity.",
    "120 Powered Exoskeletons of the latest model just arrived in Beijing.",
    "Monsters incoming! It's those Red things!",
    "120 Powered Exoskeletons of the latest model just arrived in Area P1.",
    "Around 5000 aliens and countless drones, monsters, with the Mothership setting up barriers over the sky.",
    "The human civilization is collapsing. It's very likely we will never rebuild our world if we lose more forces.",
    "Even if we lose… we must defeat at least 70% of the enemies, or we're doomed without a future.",
    "Operation in Beijing is about to begin.",

    "Comm. from Beijing. Victory is ours.",

    "New weapons rule!",

    "Doesn't sound fair, but I like it!",
    "They're attacking the citizens!",
    "隊長44",
    "This is a private message. You have achieved brilliant combat results. Was it pure luck or do you really possess such skills? Either way, you are worthy of attention.",
    "Did they sneak into the ground?!",
    "If they can move underground, they should still be around.",
    "Monsters coming from the ground!",

    "隊長45",

    "兵士734",
    "Copy that!",
    "There's no use hiding in the buildings if the anchors crash down. Estimate the dropping location and dodge the attack.",
    "They want us to dodge the anchors!",
    "Well good luck with that!",
    "Look up!!",
    "The Teleportation Anchors are dropping from the sky!",
    "There's another one coming down!",
    "Evade!",

    "These giant teleportation anchors will be called \"Big Anchors\" from now on.",
    "Archelus!?",
    "Destroy the Big Anchors at once.",
    "Good job. We stopped the alien attack once again.",
    "The Intelligence Division is very interested in you. We will start to watch and record your actions from now on. I will send one of my men to you, who will surely become a great help.",
    "I'm referring to that secret weapon which killed lots of aliens in Beijing.",
    "So fast!!",
    "It's only rumor among soldiers. There's no such thing as a secret weapon.",
    "What? So you're saying...",
    "They can't handle air pollution.",
    "We assume that feature in Area P1 has played a key role.",
    "Are they some poor indigenous brought by the creators of the civilization from who-knows-what planet?",
    "The aliens could also be clone soldiers.",
    "Disposable assets. No one cares if they'll die from air pollution.",
    "We've confirmed a swarm of flying-types, but we haven't received reports about them dropping Teleportation Ships yet. They must have been bred by the earlier monsters.",
    "隊長46",
    "They're coming!!",

    "We're dead! The red ones must be stronger!",
    "The red monsters appear to be a mutated form of the flying-type. Their appearance is almost identical.",
    "That giant monster is queen to the flying-type. Destroy it at once.",
    "We have confirmed a pack of the flying-types. Be alert.",
    "兵士1287",
    "There's another pack of the flying-type. Watch out.",
    "There comes a large group of the flying-type. A lot of them.",

    "Bad news. Mothership No.8 is drawing close.",
    "What's with that giant...",

    "兵士588",

    "兵士589",
    "This is our best chance of shooting down the Mothership.",
    "We must secure the high ground.",
    "Infantry, move. Don't let the enemy approach the overpass.",
    "So we're decoys.",
    "If we let them get close, the Railguns will be vulnerable. This is the best way.",
    "Attack the Araneas!",
    "Advance 1 block!",
    "There're numerous monsters and aliens under the Mothership.",
    "It's robots! The robots are coming down!",
    "These are bipedal robots! And it looks like they are carrying some kind of weapon!",
    "Humanoid robots!",
    "Engage enemy robots. Destroy them.",
    "Damn it.",
    "I've seen aliens deploying giant walkers to destroy earth on animes, but I never thought I would see this in real life.",
    "This city is about to be taken over by the robots!",
    "And they have advanced equipment! They are difficult to deal with.",
    "They are deceptively fast for their size!",
    "Looks like the aliens are really here to stay.",
    "Enemies coming from the right!",
    "They are decoys!",
    "From the left!",
    "Run! Run! AHHH!!!",
    "We suspect the aliens are not wearing armors but spacesuits.",
    "So they can move freely in the polluted air, I see.",
    "These are decoys in the front!",
    "隊長81",
    "AHHH!!",
    "Hide inside the building. Hurry!",
    "Let's hide! Get into the building!",
    "Air crafts and choppers can't get close due to attacks from the mothership. Ground units will come for support so don't give up. You must hang in there.",
    "Those guys haven't noticed us. We might just kill them out of surprise.",
    "Oh no, they saw us!",
    "Shotguns!!!!",
    "Noble to Barga B. Detachment procedure in place.",
    "AHHH!!!",
    "Large Monster detected!",
    "Stay away from me! Ahhhhhhh!",
    "This is Rescue Team A! Engaging the aliens!",
    "Team B! Under attack!",
    "If it goes on like this, we will be wiped out! Permission to retreat!",
    "We can't hold any longer! Retreat! Retreat!",
    "Did the aliens expect a Rescue Team?",
    "Someone killed the aliens!",
    "That was amazing! Who are you really!?",
    "Damn! We're exposed!",
    "I got separated from my men. I'm going for a search.",
    "Quiet, or they'll find us.",
    "I'm so glad to be alive.",
    "You're not part of the Rescue Teams. That's really something.",
    "Let's leave the building and fight against the enemies.",
    "Looks bad. They'll see us.",
    "Rescue Team? Doesn't seem like it.",

    "I'm the only survivor. Request for support.",

    "This is Fencer. We have 2 survivors. Come quick. Anyone.",
    "フェンサー兵士3（生存者）",
    "I thought this would be the end of me.",
    "We have to attack what's inside the spacesuit in order to defeat the aliens. Attacking the spacesuit itself is useless, if we don't concentrate our attacks on a single spot.",
    "That was really a close call.",
    "But I wonder what they did to the city...",
    "A Mothership!",
    "We did everything we could to stop the mothership...",
    "Fire at the drones.",
    "Just 2? Gone 1. Good luck.",
    "隊長50",
    "We are equipped with Anti-materiel sniper rifles. Leave them to us.",

    "The battle will soon be over.",
    "Something is coming out from the Mothership!",
    "What's that!?",
    "It's a new type of drone!",

    "We put up a good fight. However it seems that was only a recon unit. The true power of the enemy is unpredictable.",

    "What is that device?!",
    "Robots that can fight regardless of the terrain…Can't believe they created these fearsome machineries...",
    "Aim at their feet! Destroy the cannons on them!",
    "The enemy's strenth was greatly reduced after we destroyed the leg cannons. Attack their legs.",
    "Look up! More are coming!",
    "Fireballs!!",
    "Dropping off from the sky!",
    "兵士680",
    "Is this happening around the globe!? Can't imagine how bad the situation will be!",
    "If me miss one it will be a horrible disaster. You need to destroy them all.",
    "We have confirmed something is coming down from the sky.",
    "兵士681",
    "The robots keep increasing!",
    "They are just standing still.",
    "The city will be in ruins once this many robots start their invasion. There's no time for the air force. Let's do it.",
    "隊長51",
    "Their legs are designed with cannons. We should focus on the legs and weaken their attacks.",
    "Eyes up! More are coming!",
    "兵士686",
    "Aliens, 2 to go.",
    "Something is coming down.",
    "Barga standing by.",
    "Something is going on up there.",
    "There's something falling from the sky.",
    "We suggest you equip small interceptor missiles that can bring down missiles from Deroys.",
    "We'll try that if there's a next time. This city will be in serious trouble if we don't eliminate these things immediately.",
    "隊長52",
    "Nix 4, master arm on.",
    "Shoot the missiles down!",
    "Destroyed Deroy.",
    "Destroyed Deroy B successfully!",
    "What's the situation now?",
    "I know it's a night raid, but who says they sleep at night?",
    "兵士781",
    "Those monsters act slower at night.",
    "It will slightly increase our chances. And slighty is better than nothing.",
    "Launch attack at the Teleportation Ships.",

    "I'll just apologize in advance.",
    "Many different kinds of monsters!",
    "I'm sorry. We failed Operation Mysterious Monster.",
    "I'm sorry. We failed the Operation Archelus.",
    "We have put in our best effort and yet we still failed to defeat it…",
    "Teleportation Ship is destroyed.",
    "A very big one!",
    "Teleportation Ship is down.",
    "This is Wing Diver 2. We've arrived.",
    "This area is right on the projected path of the mysterious monster.",
    "The mysterious monster is about to pass this area.",
    "The mysterious monster is coming.",
    "We don't have enough fire power.",
    "Fire at the mysterious monster. Don't let it walk away unscathed.",
    "We will call this creature \"Archelus.\" from now on. We have launched several large scale attacks, but still failed to cause any critical damage to it.",
    "We can't handle it with the current equipment. Retreat at once.",
    "兵士692",

    "You really made it here. This is hell!",
    "Thank you for coming to the rescue!",
    "隊長53",
    "Good. Commence operation.",
    "Destroying the spacesuits is not good enough for defeating the enemies. We must attack the aliens inside.",
    "Do more than destroying the spacesuits! Focus your attacks on the same place! Kill the aliens inside!",
    "Concentrate your fire on the same spot!",
    "This is Bird 1. Engaging hostiles.",
    "The hero always makes a dramatic entrance, am I right?",
    "This is a difficult mission, but it has to be done.",
    "隊長54",
    "Nix 2, getting hit!",

    "We have confirmed landing ships.",
    "Operation was a success. Mission completed.",
    "隊長57",
    "We have confirmed the Mother Monster is among the monsters. The aliens might plan to use the Mother Monster to multiply monsters.",
    "We found traces of the Mother Monster. We are in for a tough battle.",
    "As long as that device is intact, more monsters will keep coming. Deal with it.",
    "隊長58",
    "You fought with Mother Monsters before, right? We will count on you.",
    "The aliens are protecting those monsters. It's too dangerous to deal with them all at once.",
    "Get into a building right away when the Mother Monster starts spewing acid!",
    "兵士706",

    "Eliminate the monster!",

    "Humans are no match for Aliens being protected by the light barrier.",
    "Can we destroy the Shield Bearers?",
    "While the Shield Bearers block our attacks, they allow aliens' attacks and buildings to pass through. This means they will determine whether the contacting objects are threatening. In other words, if they don't see us as threats... Humans should be able to go through the barrier with a low speed.",
    "You mean just directly hit the barrier?",
    "In Australia, a Fencer unit bravely broke through the barrier successfully.",
    "But they were completely annihilated eventually. We must prepare for the worst.",

    "We intended to kill Archelus, but surprisingly Blazer didn't work.",
    "We have a plan to defeat Archelus.",
    "Archelus has an uncanny regeneration ability. That's why our artillery fire can't harm it. Therefore, we should attack Archelus using things with  equivalent weight to that monster and thus crush it the moment they collide.",
    "There should be mobile cranes in Base 228.",
    "Retreat. And stop agitating Archelus.",
